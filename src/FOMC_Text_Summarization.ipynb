      " Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates. The decision was taken to move toward a less accommodative stance in monetary policy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion. Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the Committee's purposes, given the fact that this is the first firming of reserve market conditions by the Committee since early 1989.\n",

Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability. The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability. The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions.Federal Reserve ActionsThe Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/2 percent.

Spreads of rates on GSE debt and on GSE-guaranteed mortgages have widened appreciably of late.  This action is being taken to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for the purchase of houses, which in turn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally. Purchases of up to $100 billion in GSE direct obligations under the program will be conducted with the Federal Reserve's primary dealers through a series of competitive auctions and will begin next week.  Purchases of up to $500 billion in MBS will be conducted by asset managers selected via a competitive process with a goal of beginning these purchases before year-end.  Purchases of both direct obligations and MBS are expected to take place over several quarters.  Further information regarding the operational details of this program will be provided after consultation with market participants.\n",

      " The focus of the Committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level.  As previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent.

      "  Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth.

Federal Reserve ActionsThe Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Swiss National Bank. The arrangements with the Bank of England, the ECB, and the Swiss National Bank will provide these central banks with the capacity to conduct tenders of U.S. dollars in their local markets at fixed rates for full allotment, similar to arrangements that had been in place previously. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada would support drawings of up to $30 billion, as was the case previously.\n",

Growth in household spending has moderated, although households' real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high. A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.

      " To ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample, the Committee approved by notation vote completed on October 11, 2019 the following steps: These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of the FOMC's monetary policy, and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. The Committee will continue to monitor money market developments as it assesses the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation. The Committee stands ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.\n",

      " However, most saw the gains   in the economy as more solidly based than earlier in the expansion,   and they generally expected the economy to settle into a pattern of   moderate growth over coming quarters at a trend rate close to or   somewhat above the economy's long-run potential. Nonetheless, views varied somewhat with regard to the outlook   and ranged from expectations of some modest further decline in the   core rate of inflation to concerns about the possibility of some   acceleration in the context of diminishing margins of unemployed   production resources and an accommodative monetary policy as reflected   in low real short-term interest rates and continued rapid growth in   narrow measures of money and reserves. On balance,   however, current developments did not point to a marked deviation from   the moderate growth trend in economic activity that had been   experienced over the past two years, though in the view of a number of   members the odds on somewhat stronger growth were greater than they   had been earlier in the expansion. Some members cautioned, however,   that growth in consumer expenditures had exceeded gains in incomes for   an extended period, insofar as could be judged from available data,   and an already low saving rate seemed likely to limit the potential   growth in such spending. Continuing increases in business   sales and low financing costs along with ongoing efforts to improve   productivity were likely to remain conducive to substantial further   growth in overall spending for business equipment despite persisting   weakness in aerospace and defense-related industries.\n",

      " Consumer spending, which had   tended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to   increase at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on   durable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some   restraint. On balance,   financial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic   expansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more   accommodative lending policies of many depository institutions;   however, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low   probability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could   at some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and   consumer confidence and spending. More generally, currently positive business   attitudes augured well for further growth in overall business   investment, but on the negative side it was noted that further   turbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse   implications for investment spending. Members also referred to the potential for higher prices in the food   and energy sectors; low crop carryovers for some grains made food   prices vulnerable to unfavorable growing conditions, should they   materialize; oil prices currently were at relative lows but were   likely to come under some upward pressures as world economic growth   accelerated and if political developments led to disruptions in world   supplies. While a quite accommodative policy stance   had been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when   constraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and   business restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the   expansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly   diminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum.\n",

      " Market concerns about political developments in   Japan as well as a worsened outlook for progress toward more open   trading relationships and for a more stimulative fiscal policy in that   country contributed to downward pressure on the dollar. Consumer spending, which had outpaced gains in household   income for some time, was projected to slow to a growth rate more in   line with the expansion of income; with pent-up demands apparently   reduced and somewhat higher interest rates exerting a damping effect,   much of the slowing was expected to be centered on outlays for durable   goods. The members continued to see   moderate growth at a rate in line with or slightly above the economy's   potential as the most likely prospect, but the overall momentum of the   expansion and the still accommodative stance of monetary policy   suggested that there was an appreciable risk of faster growth for a   period, with consequent implications for greater pressures on   resources. With production straining capacity limits in a number of industries   and firms striving for cost savings and productivity improvements to   maintain their competitiveness, real outlays for producers' durable   equipment were likely to stay on a strong upward trend despite an   anticipated deceleration in business output and the recently increased   cost of external capital associated with higher interest rates and   lower equity prices. With survey   reports indicating that order backlogs had grown and lead times on   materials deliveries had lengthened, the possibility was increasing   that desired inventory ratios might be adjusted upward and some pickup   in inventory investment might get under way, especially in   manufacturing where stocks-to-sales ratios recently had fallen to new   lows.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Business fixed investment was thought likely to continue to   provide appreciable stimulus to the expansion, though to a diminishing   extent in the context of slower overall growth in economic activity   and higher financing costs. Nonresidential construction expenditures   were expected to post moderate increases after stagnating earlier; in   this connection, a number of members observed that commercial vacancy   rates were declining in various metropolitan areas and improved demand   for space was likely to generate increased construction activity. Comments   from numerous business contacts around the country continued to   indicate that despite the rising costs of many materials used in the   production process, highly competitive markets rendered it very   difficult or impossible to pass these higher costs through to prices   of finished goods. In their evaluation of   appropriate growth ranges for 1994, the members anticipated that the   projected moderation in the expansion of nominal GDP and the   likelihood that funds would continue to be diverted from deposits to   higher yielding market instruments would be reflected in relatively   sluggish growth in M2 and M3 and further increases in their velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to these monetary measures. The Committee noted that the current ranges,   which had been reduced greatly over the years, could be viewed as   long-run benchmarks for monetary growth consistent with maximum   sustainable economic expansion in a noninflationary environment, if   there were a return to more normal velocity behavior. The costs of reversing a policy stance   that turned out to be slightly too tight would be limited to somewhat   slower economic growth for a time; the expansion appeared to be so   well established at this juncture that the risks of a greater economic   adjustment were remote.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Growth   in consumer spending was projected to slow in response to smaller   gains in employment and income, some reductions in pent-up demands,   and the adverse effects on household financial wealth of earlier   increases in interest rates and declines in stock market prices. Business fixed investment, while remaining relatively brisk, was   expected to decelerate somewhat over the forecast horizon, primarily   owing to smaller projected gains in sales, a growing shortfall of   corporate cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing   costs. Sustained   expansion, perhaps at a pace broadly in line with or a bit above the   economy's long-run growth potential, remained a reasonable   expectation, but many members observed that they saw the risks as   being on the upside of such a projection in the absence of some   further policy tightening. One member commented that some pause in   the expansion of overall consumer spending would not be unusual after   several quarters of robust growth, and another remarked that the rise   in household expenditures had been larger than the increase in   household cash incomes by an appreciable margin over the past year. It was difficult to assess the extent of remaining margins of   available resources, in part because of uncertainty about the effects   on capacity of ongoing efforts to improve productivity through   business restructurings and sharp increases in business investment   expenditures. From a   differing perspective, one member noted that decelerating growth in   money measures such as Ml, the monetary base, and reserves--which had   been expanding rapidly for several years--implied that monetary policy   had been moved substantially to curtail any increase in inflation   pressures, though more action might still be required.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   growth in economic activity would slow appreciably over the next   several quarters, dropping briefly below the rate of increase in the   economy's potential output. After an extended period of very rapid increases, growth in   business fixed investment also was expected to slow appreciably,   partly reflecting less favorable financial conditions and partly the   slower pace of output growth. They still viewed significant slowing in the pace   of the expansion as a reasonable expectation, though they acknowledged   that signs of such slowing currently were limited and in particular   that the most recent data indicated a greater probability of somewhat   more strength in aggregate demand than had appeared to be developing   during the late spring and early summer. At this time, it was extremely difficult to evaluate   whether the earlier tightening moves were exerting a lesser effect   than usual or it simply was more delayed, or whether the members might   have misjudged the underlying strength of the expansion. While various money and related   measures had for many years proved unreliable to a greater or lesser   extent in gauging economic prospects, the weak growth in a wide array   of these measures could not be entirely disregarded as a possible   indicator of the degree of monetary restraint and argued for caution   in implementing any further policy tightening. Reflecting strength     in motor vehicles, industrial production rose sharply in     August after posting sizable gains in other recent     months, and capacity utilization moved up further from     already high levels.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " They   saw few signs that growth in aggregate demand might be moderating   toward a more sustainable pace; nonetheless, they continued to view   some slowing as a reasonable expectation as the monetary policy   tightening actions implemented earlier exerted their lagged effects on   interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. At this point, increases   in prices of final goods and services and in wages generally did not   appear to be trending higher, but the members were concerned that   inflation would worsen as the effects of continuing strong demand,   rising production costs, and higher import prices increasingly were   felt in an environment where the utilization of labor and other   producer resources was already at, if not above, sustainable full   employment levels. The evidence of persisting growth in aggregate demand at a   pace appreciably above that of the economy's long-run potential and of   developing pressures on resources tended to be confirmed by anecdotal   reports of robust business expansion in many parts of the country and   growing difficulties in hiring and retaining some types of labor. Ongoing cutbacks in some industries, such as defense, were tending to   hold down overall economic activity in a few regions, but all parts of   the country appeared to be experiencing at least modest economic   growth, including California where economic activity now seemed to   have turned up after an extended period of weakness. Even so,   at least some modest worsening of inflation seemed quite likely over   the quarters immediately ahead, despite the persistence of strong   competition that continued to limit attempts to raise prices in most   markets.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Growth of consumer spending was expected to decline   substantially in response to slower income growth, higher borrowing   costs, and reductions in household net worth associated with lower   asset values. Rates on adjustable home mortgages were moving higher to catch   up with market rates and these increases along with the wealth effects   from losses suffered on bond and stock holdings were likely to damp   spending. Anecdotal reports   continued to point to very strong competition in most markets for   final goods, and business firms continued to encounter widespread   resistance in their efforts to increase prices as the costs of their   raw materials and other inputs moved higher. It was noted that the Committee might   have gained some leeway to maintain an unchanged policy without   adverse expectational effects in light of the relatively large policy   tightening implemented just a few weeks ago and the publication of   favorable price and wage data that probably had alleviated, at least   temporarily, concerns about future inflation. Should the need for   more restraint become apparent, it would be desirable in this view for   the appropriate policy move to be made promptly to arrest any   worsening of inflation and inflationary expectations, thereby   minimizing the cumulative policy tightening that would be required and   the ultimate cost of bringing inflation under control. Those in the direction of   appreciably greater-than-projected slowing in the expansion might have   a relatively low probability, at least over the quarters immediately   ahead, but that risk could not be ruled out and argued for a cautious   approach to any further tightening.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Consumer     spending was projected to be well sustained for a time but to be     restrained later by smaller gains in real incomes, the satisfaction of     pent-up demands, and the lagged effects of higher interest rates on     the demand for durable goods. Members commented that the strong growth in economic activity     and high levels of resource utilization had fostered relatively rapid     increases in the prices of many raw materials and semi-finished goods     used in the production process, but contrary to numerous forecasts     these developments had not led thus far to a broad pickup in inflation     as measured by the prices of final goods and services. While some     acceleration in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates from the     pace in 1994 could be anticipated over the year ahead according to a     staff analysis, monetary expansion within the ranges in question     appeared to be consistent with the moderation in the expansion of     nominal GDP that the members were projecting for 1995 and that they     viewed as desirable to head off increasing inflation. In     these circumstances, a delay in tightening policy would incur an     unacceptable risk of allowing further inflationary momentum to develop     in the economy and would require more tightening over time than might     otherwise be needed to achieve the Committee's objectives. Some tightening of policy at this meeting was generally     anticipated in markets, and a failure to take action now was likely in     the view of a number of members to raise questions about the     credibility of the System's anti-inflation resolve and to generate     some unsettlement in financial markets, notably in the foreign     exchange market where the dollar already appeared to be vulnerable to     further weakness.\n",

      "----------------------\n",
      " At the consumer level, prices rose a little more rapidly in the first     quarter, despite unchanged food prices and lower energy prices. A number of members expressed concern that     the risks were still tilted in the direction of some further step-up     in inflation; however, others were more inclined to the view that     inflation was not likely to rise much further in a climate of moderate     growth in demand, intense competitive pressures in many markets, and     relatively subdued increases in labor costs. In     at least one view, however, consumer credit had been growing at a pace     that could not be sustained and the inevitable correction could     coincide with and exacerbate emerging weakness in consumer demand. On the     negative side, some members referred to the possibility that a longer     period might be needed to resolve the difficulties being experienced     by Mexico, and several expressed particular concern about the     potential for relatively severe disruptions to trade if current     negotiations with Japan were not successfully concluded. A number of members expressed concern     that, with the economy already producing at or even slightly above its     sustainable potential, inflation pressures were likely to intensify if     the current pause in the expansion were to be followed by a period of     above-average growth. The higher interest rates of 1994 clearly     had damped demand, but since year-end intermediate- and long-term     market rates had declined, stock market prices had risen, bank lending     terms had continued to ease, and the dollar had fallen against the     currencies of many major industrial countries.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The ongoing     adjustments needed to bring these inventories down to desired levels     were seen as the most serious threat to the expansion. While consumer     confidence had declined earlier, recent surveys indicated that     confidence had stabilized or even edged up more recently and was in     any event at relatively high levels in most parts of the country. While some concern was     expressed about the vulnerability of capital spending to a downturn in     the growth of sales, the members generally expected this sector of the     economy to remain a positive factor in the expansion. Economic activity in the major foreign     industrial nations had been more sluggish than anticipated during the     first half of the year, and this raised questions about the strength     of the expansion in those countries and the related prospects for the     faster growth in U.S. exports. The members agreed that     under present economic conditions a slight easing of the stance of     policy would incur little risk of stimulating increased inflation and     would be entirely consistent with their commitment to continued     progress toward price stability over time. The declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates were     helping to support the expansion, but those declines rested in part on     market expectations of significant monetary policy easing; failure to     ratify such expectations could well result in at least a partial     reversal of those desirably lower rates. One member emphasized that,     while the risks of greater inflation seemed small, the costs of a     policy error in the direction of too much easing would be high in     terms of its effects on the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy and the need to rein in inflationary growth next     year.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  Consumer prices rose more slowly in June and July, with food     and energy price movements having little effect on the overall index;     price increases for nonfood, non-energy items were somewhat smaller     than those seen earlier in the year. Producer     prices of finished goods edged lower on balance in June and July,     reflecting substantial declines in prices of finished energy goods. Total hourly compensation for private     industry workers increased somewhat more in the second quarter than in     the first; however, the rise in compensation costs for the year ended     in June was smaller than that for the previous year, primarily     reflecting slower growth in costs of benefits. Accompanying slower growth of sales and profits, business investment     in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from the very     rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of capital     and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain     appreciable expansion in such investment. Further growth in final     demand was generating an improvement in overall business activity,     despite a more rapid adjustment in inventory investment than many had     expected. This configuration suggested that the risks of recession or     an extended period of subpar growth were now reduced, and sustained     expansion at a moderate pace was seen as the most likely course for     the economy. Others expressed concern, however, that the     uncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy included     questions about the persistence of inflationary sentiment and the     prospects for further progress toward stable prices over the next     several quarters.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Sizable declines in     energy prices were a contributing factor, but price increases also had     moderated for nonfood, non-energy items; the moderation largely     reflected a downturn in automobile finance charges and used-car prices     along with smaller increases in airline fares. Although declines in prices of finished energy goods held down the     overall index in both months, prices of finished goods other than food     and energy rose more slowly than in the early months of the year; for     the twelve months ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices of     finished goods increased slightly more than in the comparable year-earlier period. Consumer spending was expected to grow at a     pace generally in line with incomes; the favorable effects on spending     of higher prices for financial assets held by households would be     offset to a degree in this forecast by less robust labor market     conditions and the difficulties that growing numbers of households     would encounter in servicing their enlarged debts. The outlook for economic activity remained subject to a variety of     uncertainties, including the still unsettled course of the federal     budget, and many members saw the risks of a shortfall from expectations as slightly greater than those of significantly faster growth. Moreover, the rise in worker compensation had been unusually     restrained in recent years in relation to the strong demand for     workers, evidently reflecting the effects of worker concerns about job     security in a period of business restructurings and downsizings, but     continued strength in the demand for labor might be expected to induce     more rapid increases in labor compensation over time. They thought it would be     premature to ease policy without greater assurance that inflation had     been contained in the current cyclical expansion and that prospects     for significant further progress toward the long-run objective of     price level stability had improved.\n",

      " Consumer     spending was expected to expand at a rate generally in line with the     growth of incomes; the favorable effects of higher prices on financial     assets held by households would be offset to some extent by the     difficulties of increasing numbers of households in servicing their     growing debts. A number     of members commented that they saw a basis in this development for     mild optimism about the outlook for inflation, but others expressed     concern that, in the context of current forecasts for economic     activity and relatively high levels of resource use, progress toward     lower inflation was unlikely over the projection period and indeed     there was a risk of some modest deterioration in price performance. The members generally believed, however, that in light of     the underlying strength of the economy, the retarding effects of     likely federal budget developments would not be sufficient in     themselves to arrest the expansion over the forecast period, at least     if the federal government shutdown were of relatively short duration     and a federal debt default were averted. While a number of members     believed that these developments might augur a modest decline in     inflation over the year ahead, given current forecasts of moderate     economic expansion, many viewed as more likely the prospect of little     or no progress toward price stability over coming quarters and some     expressed concern about the potential for an upward drift in the rate     of inflation. The intermediate forecast was subject to a number of     significant risks: household balance sheets seemed unlikely to sustain     the current rate of durables expenditure for any extended period;     government expenditures were certain to be cut substantially; and with     fiscal contractions underway in Europe and Canada and severe financial     stresses present in Japan and Mexico, he did not see much likelihood     of a substantial expansion of exports.\n",

      " The rise that     had occurred in the value of financial assets held by households would     be a positive factor helping to support consumer spending but one that     would be offset to a degree by the difficulties of an increasing     number of households in servicing their growing debts. Members noted that the     reluctance of consumers also might be reflecting a sense of continued     job insecurity in an environment of ongoing business restructuring and     downsizing, higher debt service burdens and rising delinquency rates,     and the satisfaction of pent-up demand for durable goods. In this     environment, and with the economy expected to expand at a     comparatively moderate pace over the forecast period, many members     anticipated that inflation would remain relatively stable despite     continuing high levels of resource utilization, and some believed that     it might record a somewhat improved performance. One argument     advanced in support of a possibly better performance was that the     recent experience, which had been more favorable than expected given     capacity utilization levels, was perhaps suggestive of the effects of     rapid technological improvements on productivity, the enhanced     efficiencies from greater economic specialization around the world,     and the influence of heightened job insecurity on wages and prices. Although there was no sign that a     cumulative deterioration in economic performance was about to get     under way, the downside risks to the expansion appeared to have     increased and a modest easing would better position policy to guard     against the possibility that over the longer term the expansion would     begin to fall short of the economy's potential, especially with fiscal     policy likely to be at least moderately restrictive.\n",

In the days immediately following themeeting, rates rose sharply in response to incoming data, notably theemployment report for June that market participants viewed asindicating increasing pressures on economic resources and labor costs.Subsequently, however, that rise was more than reversed when furtherdata releases were interpreted as suggesting that the economicexpansion might be slowing and that the upturn in labor compensationwas mild.

It was noted that much of thestimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year hadbeen provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables,housing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spendingcould be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfiedpent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases inintermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitivesectors of the economy.\n",

      " With regard to labor costs, growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers declined significantly over the twelve months ended in September, evidently reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment and the drop in consumer price inflation.At its meeting on September 24, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-3/4 percent, and it also retained a balance of risks statement that was tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future. These included the prospect of strengthening consumer confidence  if geopolitical uncertainties began to dissipate, the gradual diminution of the negative wealth effects from earlier stock market declines, and importantly the outlook for continued robust growth in structural labor productivity and its favorable effects over time on wages and salaries. Looking to the future, the timing and strength of a decisive upturn in capital expenditures, a key factor in the outlook for some improvement in the performance of the overall economy, would depend critically on the dissipation of prevailing uncertainties, including those associated with geopolitical risks, and increasing prospects for profits. The economy probably would continue to underperform in the period immediately ahead, but in the absence of unpredictable adverse shocks this sluggish performance was more likely to be balanced by subsequent economic strength in light of the policy action. In the view of many members, retaining the assessment that the risks were tilted toward weakness would raise the odds of an overreaction in financial markets, which might well misread the Committee's decision as a sign that the members were more concerned about the potential for greater economic weakness than was in fact the case and that therefore the Committee currently saw a likely need for further easing later.\n",

      " The successful prosecution of the war had served to reduce geopolitical uncertainties and in turn had helped to foster a marked strengthening of domestic financial markets, a sizable decline in oil prices, and an apparent upturn in consumer confidence. In this improved environment, members anticipated that near-term sluggishness in economic growth would give way to more vigorous expansion as the year progressed. Continued progress in lifting various constraints on economic growth, including the unwinding of excessive or misdirected capital expenditures undertaken in earlier years and the steps taken to address corporate governance and credit problems were also working to strengthen the expansion. Despite underlying factors that seemed increasingly conducive to an accelerating expansion, members noted that the timing and vigor of a pickup in economic activity remained uncertain, especially in the context of a persistently high degree of caution in the business community with regard to investment and hiring decisions. Members commented that substantial additional disinflation would be unwelcome because of the likely negative effects on economic activity and the functioning of financial institutions and markets, and the increased difficulty of conducting an effective monetary policy, at least potentially in the event the economy was subjected to adverse shocks. In particular, the lifting of key uncertainties relating to the war would provide an improved opportunity to assess whether the favorable factors in the outlook would in fact lead to the anticipated strengthening in economic activity and, at the same time, diminish the risk of appreciable further disinflation. Some members cautioned that persisting uncertainty regarding economic trends should not provide a basis for prolonged inaction in light of the risks of further disinflation and subpar economic growth.\n",

      " Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose a bit less than those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, but risk spreads on below-investment-grade bonds narrowed significantly as their yields increased by a more modest amount. Major equity price indexes were about unchanged, as the downward pressure exerted by higher interest rates was offset by the effects of strong earnings reports, upward revisions to expected future earnings, and other positive economic news. Anecdotal information gathered from business contacts across the nation-particularly commentary suggesting rising orders, improving confidence, and a growing willingness to increase payrolls-tended to confirm the data that pointed to increasingly solid expansion. The probable persistence of slack in the economy for at least several more quarters, together with the likelihood that recent substantial gains in productivity would be extended, should continue to exert slight downward pressures on inflation. At the same time, though, the recent stronger-than-expected increases in a number of price measures, anecdotal information suggesting a greater ability of businesses to implement and sustain price hikes, and multiplying signs of solid economic growth suggested that the upside risks to inflation had increased. These members noted that current economic circumstances made it likely that the process of returning policy to a more neutral setting would be more gradual, once under way, than in past episodes when inflation was well above levels consistent with price stability.

      " The sizable current account deficit could be viewed as reflecting very low levels of national saving, in both its government and private components, in relation to investment opportunities in the United States that were very attractive. Members of the Committee noted that monetary policy was not well equipped to promote the adjustment of external imbalances but could best contribute by maintaining an environment of price stability that would foster maximum sustainable economic growth. Business investment spending appeared to have advanced at a brisk pace in the second quarter, as rising output, low user cost of capital, and increased corporate cash flow continued to foster a favorable environment for capital spending. Imports of goods edged higher, as a large decline in the value of imported oil was offset by an increase in imports of non-oil products, and imports of services increased. In April and May, increases in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls exceeded the monthly gains registered in the first quarter and were well above the increases in the fourth quarter of 2003. Those who anticipated a noticeable deceleration emphasized the contribution of the one-time price increases that had boosted inflation recently, persisting, albeit diminishing, margins of unemployed labor and other productive resources, the anticipation of strong further gains in productivity and declines in markups of goods prices over costs, and steady long-term inflation expectations. They agreed to retain the assessments adopted at the May meeting indicating that they viewed the upside and downside risks to both the attainment of sustainable economic growth and to the goal of price stability as roughly in balance for the next few quarters.\n",

      " During the summer, gasoline inventories climbed above seasonal norms because of lower demand and increased imports, and the resulting downward pressure on margins led gasoline prices to fall even as crude oil prices moved higher. At its meeting on August 10, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1½ percent, and to retain its assessment of balanced risks with respect to sustainable economic growth and price stability. In its announcement, the Committee noted that output growth had moderated in recent months and that the pace of improvement in labor market conditions had slowed, but that the softness likely owed importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices. While credit spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds narrowed a bit, spreads on speculative-grade issues fell significantly more, particularly in riskier segments of the market, probably reflecting greater confidence about prospects in the business sector. Consumer spending was expected to pick up in conjunction with the strengthening labor market and associated gains in wages and salaries that would offset the effects of an anticipated rise in the savings rate from its recent low level. Although higher energy prices had played an important role in damping growth, questions remained about the reasons for the shortfall from expectations held this spring, and several policymakers remarked that their uncertainty about the likely pace of the expansion going forward had risen. Although payroll growth had been weak in June and July, it registered a somewhat better performance in August, and initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to hover around relatively low levels.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Oil prices were anticipated to decline somewhat with the repair of hurricane-related damage to oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to some slowing in inflation. The staff expected business investment spending to slow sharply early next year as partial-expensing provisions expired, but then to pick up noticeably in response to favorable financing conditions, ample business liquidity, and the need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software. In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective developments, the members generally expressed assessments that economic expansion in the neighborhood of the rate of growth of the economy’s potential appeared to have become even more firmly established over recent months, despite the drag from higher energy prices. Looking forward, economic fundamentals appeared to be favorable for continued solid growth, and while fiscal stimulus would abate next year, a flattening out of energy prices, as markets seemed to anticipate, would bolster economic expansion. The high-tech sector, and investment in information technology more generally, had been growing less rapidly of late and was seen as posing a possible downside risk to the outlook. If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations. They agreed to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced and to reiterate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The steep run-up in housing prices, recent increases in equity prices, and anticipated gains in payrolls were viewed as likely to boost the growth of consumption spending next year to a pace somewhat above that recorded this year. That improvement was expected to persist and, along with higher wealth and relatively low interest rates, would support further gains in spending by households. A number of participants cited the recent depreciation of the dollar on foreign exchange markets, elevated energy costs, and the possibility of a slowing in underlying productivity growth as factors tending to boost the upside risks to their inflation outlook, though, on net, they saw the risks to stable underlying inflation as still balanced. Although oil prices had fallen of late, they were still considerably higher than they had been in the spring, and the recent decline in the dollar would raise import prices and diminish competitive pressures on many industries. In addition, productivity growth had slowed appreciably in the most recent quarter and unit labor costs had increased, raising questions about cost pressures going forward. Forward market-based measures of inflation compensation beyond the next five years as well as survey measures of both short- and long-term inflation expectations had been quite stable of late, despite the previous rise in energy prices and the lower dollar. Although participants generally acknowledged that the degree of economic slack was quite uncertain, the moderate pace of wage and compensation growth in recent months in the face of higher energy prices and several years of rapid productivity growth was consistent with an economy still operating somewhat below its potential.\n",

      " Several of those who saw greater potential drawbacks were concerned thatsuch a shift might appear to be inconsistent with the Committee’s dual mandate of fosteringmaximum employment as well as price stability or that it might inappropriately bias or constrain policy at times; in any case, with inflation expectations well-contained over recent years, thebenefits of announcing a specific inflation objective were not likely to be large. In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expandat a pace a little above that of its longer-run potential over this year and next, while hiring wasexpected to firm some more, resulting in a further decrease in the unemployment rate. Householdspending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment andsomewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealthand the need for households to rebuild savings. Real net exports were projected to be roughly stable forseveral quarters, held up by the lagged effect of the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar andsome strengthening in foreign demand. The current low measured saving rate seemedmostly explainable by the strength of expected income gains, low interest rates, and the increase inhousehold wealth resulting from the rise in equity and housing prices. A number of participants noted continued modest gains in employment, though somecommented that, based on anecdotal information, job growth seemed to have picked up of late.The increase in aggregate demand was expected to be sufficient over coming quarters to allow therate of unemployment to continue to edge lower even as more people return to the labor force.Participants noted considerable uncertainty about the sustainable rate of resource utilization andabout structural productivity growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand at a rate above the growth of potential this year and next, led by strong business demand for equipment and software. In light of the robust expansion of capital spending thus far this year, the outlook for business investment spending was revised up appreciably, as more of the strength over the latter part of 2004 was attributed to underlying demand and less to the effects of the partial-expensing tax provision. Although productivity growth had slowed from the extraordinarily rapid pace that prevailed earlier in the expansion, data for the fourth quarter of 2004, as well as preliminary indications for the first quarter of this year, suggested that gains from efficiency remained substantial. Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained. Regarding the risks to sustainable growth and price stability, members discussed a proposal to make the Committee's assessment explicitly conditional on an assumption of appropriate monetary policy so as to underscore that maintaining balanced risks would require policy action. Some expressed the view that such language could constrain future policy inappropriately; while these concerns were not new, they were now felt to be more pressing, as the odds that the Committee might need to step up the pace of policy firming were thought to have increased.\n",

      "  The Committee's decision at its June meeting to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to maintain an assessment that risks to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced assuming appropriate monetary policy action, and to retain the \"measured pace\" language was widely expected in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, however, investors appreciably marked up their expectations for the path of policy, primarily in response to incoming economic data suggesting more strength in spending and output than had been anticipated. At the same time, however, it trimmed the growth rate forecast for 2006, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices, higher long-term interest rates, and the somewhat slower growth of productive capacity implied by the annual revisions to the national accounts. In addition, high and rising energy prices were adding to pressures on overall inflation, and energy price increases probably would feed through, at least temporarily, to core measures of inflation. Moreover, participants thought that some slowing in final sales was likely later this year as net exports resumed their decline and purchases of automobiles fell back with the expiration of special discount programs. For example, few indications had emerged recently that businesses had enjoyed any significant increase in pricing power, and the continuing expansion of global trade was seen as an important factor limiting firms' ability to pass through cost increases.\n",

      " Although economic growth was projected         to run a bit above the staff's estimate of the economy's potential, the         unemployment rate was projected to hold around its current level with         improvements in job prospects expected to lure more workers back into         the labor force. In addition, the prolonged period of elevated spot energy prices,         the sense supported by futures markets that these higher prices may persist         for some time, and the heightened uncertainty about energy prices going         forward, together may have left businesses less confident about the future         and wary of longer-term commitments such as expanding plant capacity or         taking on new workers. On balance, though, these financial         developments did not appear to signal the onset of a sharp retrenchment         in investors' willingness to bear risk, and capital expenditures were         seen as likely to remain quite robust, spurred by strong economic fundamentals         that included elevated profits, opportunities to raise efficiency by utilizing         new technologies, a low cost of capital, and strong corporate balance         sheets. Although downside risks to sustainable         growth had become more evident, most members regarded the recent slower         growth of economic activity as likely to be transitory. Although some members noted that a case could be made         that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and         those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most         likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and         the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks         conditional on appropriate policy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Prices of houses         in the United States had risen sharply in recent years, especially in         certain areas of the country, to very high levels relative to incomes         or rents. In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception         that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside         risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability         should be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that recent data         suggested that the solid pace of spending growth had slowed somewhat,         partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices, but that         labor market conditions apparently continued to improve gradually. The forecast for consumer price inflation was revised up, with inflation         seen as somewhat higher this year than in 2004, reflecting in part higher         import prices and the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices,         and only edging lower next year as these price pressures wane. Increases in core consumer prices had         slowed of late, though underlying inflation was still seen by most meeting         participants as likely to be modestly higher this year than last, impelled         in part by the pass-through of a further rise in energy prices. However, anticipation of slow growth seemed inconsistent with         higher stock prices and thin risk spreads in corporate debt markets. Trend unit labor costs could also be boosted by slower growth in structural         productivity; while recent evidence was not conclusive, some participants         thought the underlying pace of productivity growth might well fall back         in coming quarters following the substantial gains seen in recent years.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although uncertainties about the outlook for spending had increased, it appeared that, over time, consumption would probably expand at a moderate pace--perhaps a little below the pace of income growth once the increases in house prices slowed to more historically typical rates. This posed the risk that there could be a more persistent influence on inflation should inflation expectations rise. Measures of labor costs were giving conflicting signals, with some indexes indicating that growth in labor compensation remained relatively low but another showing appreciably more rapid increases. Anecdotal information continued to point to shortages of certain types of labor, such as truck drivers, and some business contacts reported difficulties in hiring more generally, a development that had prompted some firms to boost wages. Although uncertainty had increased, in the Committee's judgment the fundamental factors influencing the longer-term path of the economy probably had not been affected by the hurricane, but the upside risks to inflation appeared to have increased. A pause in policy tightening at this meeting had the potential to mislead the public both about the Committee's perceptions of the fundamental strength and resilience of the economy and about its commitment to fostering price stability. Although energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures, and inflation expectations had recently exhibited some signs of increasing, members agreed that the risks to inflation, as well as those to growth, remained essentially balanced under an assumption of appropriate policy action.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " One survey of households in October found that expectations for inflation over the coming year rose to a level well above the readings that had prevailed over the spring and summer, presumably in response to rising energy prices. With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry workers rose at a moderate pace in the third quarter, up somewhat from its second-quarter pace, but the twelve-month change in the index declined from that of a year earlier. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. However, the Committee judged that these unfortunate developments did not pose a more persistent threat to the overall economy. However, the expected path for monetary policy shifted up in subsequent weeks, as incoming data indicated that output had been expanding briskly prior to the hurricanes and that the disruptions to economic activity from the hurricanes were likely to be less severe than initially feared. Growth in household debt was estimated to have edged down in the third quarter because of a slowing in mortgage debt growth but remained elevated. While participants noted some recent favorable data on core inflation and labor costs, upside risks to the outlook for underlying inflation remained a key concern. Wage gains had remained modest relative to continued strong productivity growth, suggesting that labor costs were not putting much upward pressure on prices.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " And spot prices for         natural gas fell sharply through mid-November amidst unusually temperate         weather, plentiful inventories, and declining prices of competing fuels;         unusually cold weather in early December, however, caused spot prices         to move back up to their October levels. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that,         with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks         to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be         kept roughly equal. The economic expansion         had shown considerable resilience in the face of higher energy prices         and hurricane-related disruptions, suggesting greater underlying strength         than had been apparent at the time of the November meeting. At the same         time, incoming inflation data had been benign, indicating relatively modest         pass-through of higher energy prices to core inflation to date; subdued         gains in compensation and strong growth in productivity were holding down         business costs; and inflation expectations, which had jumped after the         hurricanes, had fallen back. Nonetheless, with growth solid and prices         of energy products still well above levels earlier in the year, possible         increases in resource utilization had the potential to add to pressures         on prices, especially in the absence of some further firming of policy. While inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained         contained, the Committee agreed that the announcement should indicate         that possible increases in resource utilization, as well as elevated energy         prices, had the potential to add to inflation pressures and that \"some         further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks         to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability         roughly in balance.\"\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Underlying fundamentals continued to support gains in capital spending as business sector output expanded, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines pushed down the user cost of capital equipment. The restrained growth in inventories in recent months suggested that firms outside the motor vehicle sector were intentionally keeping stockbuilding low; however, it could also have reflected an unanticipated increase in sales or supply interruptions following the hurricanes last fall. Core prices had posted a string of very low increases last summer, held down in part by falling motor vehicle prices. Preliminary survey measures of near-term inflation expectations for January had nonetheless ticked down, continuing the reversal of a sharp increase after the hurricanes last fall, and longer-term inflation expectations had moved lower as well. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid. In these circumstances, the Committee believed that some further measured policy firming was likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In that regard, several high frequency indicators of production, labor markets, and private demand suggested greater underlying strength of late than had been reflected in the most recent GDP data. Nevertheless, signs of slowing in the housing sector had become more evident, and the boost to construction from hurricane-related rebuilding now seemed likely to be spread over the next couple of years rather than being more concentrated in the near term.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although the level of single-family housing starts was unusually high in January and February, much of this strength was likely the result of mild winter weather; new permit issuance extended the downward trajectory that began in October. Sales of new homes fell in the first two months of the year, while sales of existing homes turned up in February for the first time since last August; both measures were well below their peaks of mid-2005. The economy seemed to be on track to grow near a sustainable pace with core inflation remaining close to recent readings against a backdrop of financial conditions embodying an expectation of some tightening. Since the available indicators showed that the economy could well be producing in the neighborhood of its sustainable potential and that aggregate demand remained strong, keeping rates unchanged would run an unacceptable risk of rising inflation. Most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near, and some expressed concerns about the dangers of tightening too much, given the lags in the effects of policy. In the end, they concurred that the statement should note that economic growth had rebounded in the current quarter but that it appeared likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace in coming quarters. The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Manufacturing production also posted solid gains in the first quarter and payroll growth moderated a bit in April after robust gains in employment in the first quarter. Although continued improvements in the labor market had been generating considerable gains in nominal wage and salary income, rising gasoline prices held down the increase in real disposable personal income in March and were expected to damp it in April as well. Although sales of existing single-family homes edged up in February and March, the level of sales for the first quarter as a whole was notably below the record high in the second quarter of last year. Prices of core goods and services also rose more quickly in March, largely because of a spike in the apparel component that unwound a decline in February and a one-time step-up in medical prices related to changes in Medicare reimbursement rules. In these circumstances, the Committee judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance, but reiterated that in any event the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives. Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates. Low and stable inflation expectations were key to the attainment of the Committee's dual objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants observed that housing construction activity had declined notably in recent months as indicated by lower housing starts and permits; moreover, higher inventories of unsold homes, a sharp rise in cancellations of new home sales, and reports from construction companies suggested that the weakness was likely to be extended.

      "----------------------\n",
      " Core consumer prices also continued to rise, boosted by an acceleration in shelter costs, particularly those for owner-occupied residences, and some pass-through of energy cost increases. The price of crude oil increased further over the intermeeting period, and strong weather-related demand caused the price of natural gas to rise considerably. The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been moderating from its quite strong pace earlier in the year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. Readings on core inflation had been elevated in recent months, but ongoing productivity gains had held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation expectations remained contained. Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities declined a bit more than those on comparable nominal Treasury securities, leaving inflation compensation up slightly, albeit within recent ranges. In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the slowing of GDP growth in the second quarter was generally in line with expectations, reflecting the continued cooling of the housing market, the restraining influence on demand of higher energy prices, and the lagged effects of past increases in interest rates. Going forward, output was expected to advance at a pace at or slightly below the economy’s potential rate of growth, but several participants noted that the annual revision to the national income and product accounts suggested this growth rate likely was lower than previously believed.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  The overall price index for personal consumption expenditures rose relatively steeply in July and was estimated to have increased further in August, bringing the advance over the twelve-month period above the year-earlier rise. Core consumer prices increased at a somewhat more subdued pace over July and August, but despite the recent moderation, the twelve-month change in core prices remained above the increase over the comparable period twelve months earlier. After more favorable readings in June and July, survey measures of households' inflation expectations turned back up in August, but preliminary September readings suggested a decline. The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had moderated from its quite strong pace earlier in the year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. Further ahead, the lagged effects of the previous tightening of monetary policy and waning stimulus from household wealth and fiscal policy were anticipated to restrain growth, but the drag from the downturn in residential construction was expected to abate. Looking forward, most participants thought that the most likely outcome was a reduction in inflation pressures, but the anticipated decline was only gradual and the uncertainties around that forecast were skewed toward higher rather than lower inflation rates. Members noted that certain developments of late--appreciable declines in energy prices, some softer indicators of economic activity, and slightly lower readings on core inflation--pointed to a modestly better inflation outlook and hence made the policy decision today somewhat less difficult than it was in August, when it was seen as a particularly close call.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In particular, although business output had recently been rising at a slower rate, corporate financial reserves remained plentiful and the cost of high-tech capital goods continued to fall. The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose only slightly in September; the increase was well below its average monthly advance over the preceding twelve months, reflecting a drop in prices of some chemicals that have a high energy content. The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth of real GDP had slowed further in the third quarter, reflecting both a significant drag from the continuing contraction in residential construction and a steep decline in motor vehicle assemblies. The most recent indicators suggested that economic growth had probably slowed more sharply in the third quarter than had been expected at the time of the September meeting, but that appeared to largely reflect the impact of temporary influences. Meeting participants judged that consumer expenditures going forward were likely to expand at a steady pace a little below the growth in disposable income, supported by favorable financial conditions, continued increases in employment and income, and the recent decline in energy prices. Although some participants noted that the recent slowing in core inflation had helped to allay their fears of a further sustained increase in inflation, all participants emphasized that the risks around the desired downward path to inflation remained to the upside. Although substantial uncertainty continued to attend that outlook, most members judged that the downside risks to economic activity had diminished a little, and likewise, some members felt that the upside risks to inflation had declined, albeit only slightly.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In the staff's view, these measurement issues likely caused an overstatement of the rate of increase in real GDP in the third quarter, and the gradual unwinding of those effects would probably lead to an understatement of real GDP growth over the next several quarters. Real spending on equipment and software continued to increase at a solid pace in the third quarter, supported by strong corporate cash positions and a low cost of capital. Although spending on high-tech capital goods and software expanded at a robust pace in the third quarter, data on new orders and shipments in October pointed to more moderate growth in the fourth quarter. The overall price index for personal consumption expenditures fell in September and October, reflecting sharp declines in energy prices in both months; the declines left the change in that index over the twelve months ending in October substantially lower than over the preceding twelve-month period. Growth in consumer spending was expected to be supported by favorable financial conditions and solid gains in income from employment, outweighing any damping effect of sluggish increases in housing wealth. Looking further ahead, meeting participants expected investment to expand at a solid pace, supported by strong corporate balance sheets and profits and by the ready availability of funding from financial markets and institutions, factors that were expected to be offset only partially by restraint from slower growth in final sales. More generally, participants stressed there was considerable uncertainty as to the probable pace and extent of the moderation in core inflation and that the risks around this desired downward path remained to the upside.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, with the contraction in housing activity expected to abate this year, the pace of economic growth was anticipated to edge back up to a level that was close to the staff's estimate of potential output growth by the end of 2007 and to remain in that same range throughout 2008. Against this background and with the rate of increase of shelter prices slowing down, the staff expected core inflation to edge down in 2007 and 2008. Incoming data suggesting a leveling out in housing demand and strength in consumer spending outside the housing sector supported the view that the expansion remained resilient despite the appreciable decline in housing activity and recent weakness in the manufacturing sector. Unseasonably warm weather so far this winter complicated the interpretation of recent data, but participants were optimistic that the risk of a much larger contraction in housing had diminished and that the drag on growth from the housing sector would ease later this year. To be sure, incoming data had suggested some improvement in core inflation, and a further gradual decline was seen as the most likely outcome, fostered in part by the continued stability of inflation expectations. The influence of more enduring factors, importantly including pressures in labor and product markets and the behavior of inflation expectations, would primarily determine the extent of more persistent progress. The ongoing contraction in the housing sector and the potential for spillovers to other sectors remained notable downside risks to economic activity, although those risks had diminished somewhat, and continuing strength in consumption suggested upside risks as well.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Real spending on equipment and software fell in the fourth quarter, and nominal orders for and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft posted widespread declines in January, with transportation equipment showing a very large drop. Financial market volatility increased sharply in the second half of the intermeeting period amid an apparent pullback from risk-taking that was reportedly spurred by mixed news on domestic economic activity, mounting concerns about the subprime mortgage sector, and significant declines in foreign equity prices. The recent increase in oil prices and decline in equity prices, along with increased strains in the subprime mortgage sector, were expected to exert some drag on real activity over the remainder of the year. Even so, real GDP growth was expected to pick up to a rate a little below that of the economy’s long-run potential for the remainder of 2007, as declines in residential construction activity lessened, and to remain at a similar rate in 2008. Most participants continued to expect that core inflation would slow gradually, but the recent readings on inflation and productivity growth, along with higher energy prices, had increased the odds that inflation would fail to moderate as expected; that risk remained the Committee’s predominant concern. Business fixed investment spending had been surprisingly weak of late, given strong corporate balance sheets, high profitability, anticipated growth in sales, and favorable financial conditions. Participants agreed that risks around the expected and desired path of a gradual decline in core inflation remained mainly to the upside; some noted that upside risks to inflation appeared to have increased slightly in recent months.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  Real consumer expenditures increased at a brisk pace in the first quarter, although monthly gains in spending slowed over the course of the quarter, in part because of swings in weather-related outlays on energy goods and energy services. By contrast, spending on transportation equipment declined significantly:  Although domestic spending on aircraft jumped after three weak quarters, purchases of medium and heavy trucks dropped sharply, largely as a consequence of a pull-forward of truck purchases in the latter part of last year in anticipation of the tighter emissions standards that took effect in January. In Latin America, indicators pointed to further lackluster growth in Mexico and some weakening in Argentina, but in other countries, especially Brazil, conditions appeared more positive. In its forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff expected the pace of economic activity to pick up from weak first-quarter growth to a rate a little below that of the economy's long-run potential for the remainder of this year and to increase at a pace broadly in line with potential output in 2008. In response to data received over the past year, the staff had marked down slightly its estimate of structural productivity growth and nudged up its estimate for the increase in labor supply--leaving its estimate of the overall growth of potential GDP broadly unchanged. Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although the household  wealth-to-income ratio ticked down in the first quarter with the stock market  up only a little and house prices remaining soft, the increase in stock prices  in the second quarter likely made up much of the lost ground. Economic growth in Canada rebounded sharply  from a disappointing fourth quarter, and growth picked up in the United Kingdom,  owing primarily to a robust expansion in the service sector. In the euro area, export growth in the first  quarter slowed from its rapid fourth-quarter pace, and the hike in the German  value-added tax likely temporarily depressed first-quarter consumption growth   Consumer spending showed signs of recovering  in recent months, and overall, economic conditions in the euro area remained  solid. Participants  interpreted the most recent information on business spending, business  sentiment, and the labor market as suggesting that the risks to growth were  more balanced than at the time of the May meeting, despite the ongoing  adjustment in the housing sector and the significant recent increases in longer-term  interest rates. Some participants noted a risk that the  saving rate could rise more than currently foreseen, particularly if household  wealth were depressed by a further softening in house prices or by a less  buoyant equity market that might accompany a potential slowing in the growth of  corporate earnings. At the same time,  participants recognized that consumption growth had held up to date and saw a  risk that the saving rate could fail to rise as much as currently expected,  particularly if equity markets continued to register significant gains.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Later in the intermeeting period, growing  apprehension that turmoil in markets for subprime mortgages and some low-rated  corporate debt might have adverse effects on economic growth led investors to  mark down their expectations for the future path of policy considerably further. Although part of the recent favorable monthly  readings on core PCE price changes was expected to be transitory, the staff  revised down slightly its forecast for core PCE price inflation in the second  half of 2007; however, in light of slower growth in structural productivity and  prospects of somewhat greater pressure from import prices, the staff left its projection  for core PCE inflation unchanged for 2008. In their discussion of the economic  situation and outlook, meeting participants indicated that they still saw  moderate economic expansion in coming quarters as the most likely outcome but  that the downside risks to growth had increased. Going  forward, most participants anticipated that growth in aggregate demand would be  supported by rising employment, incomes, and exports, with the result that  growth in actual output probably would remain close to growth of potential GDP despite  the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. The  expansion would be supported by solid job gains and rising real incomes that  would bolster consumption, and by increasing foreign demand for goods and  services produced in the United States. For the present,  however, given expectations that the most likely outcome for the economy was continued  moderate growth, the upside risks to inflation remained the most significant policy  concern.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes had risen considerably. Nonetheless, the increase over the four quarters ending in the second quarter was noticeably above the increase in the preceding four quarters and well above the rise in the employment cost index over the same period. Although the downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, the Committee repeated that its predominant policy concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected. The FOMC judged that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, indicated that it was monitoring the situation, and stated that it was prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets. Meeting participants also noted that financial market conditions, while seeming to have improved somewhat in the most recent days, were still fragile and that further adverse credit market developments could well increase the downside risks to the economy. Such a measure should not interfere with an adjustment to more realistic pricing of risk or with the gains and losses that implied for participants in financial markets. With economic growth likely to run below its potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side, the easing of policy seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation. Given the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Committee decided to refrain from providing an explicit assessment of the balance of risks, as such a characterization could give the mistaken impression that the Committee was more certain about the economic outlook than was in fact the case.\n",

      "----------------------\n",
      " The forecast for headline inflation was in the same range as that for core inflation in 2008 and 2009, reflecting expectations that energy prices would level off and then turn down and that increases in food prices would slow to a pace more in line with core inflation.The advance data on the national income and product accounts for the third quarter, which were released on the morning of the second day of the FOMC meeting, indicated a stronger increase in real GDP than the staff had forecast, mostly because inventory investment was estimated to be higher than projected by the staff. Participants generally viewed financial markets as still fragile and were concerned that an adverse shock--such as a sharp deterioration in credit quality or disclosure of unusually large and unanticipated losses--could further dent investor confidence and significantly increase the downside risks to the economy. Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity. Members also agreed that economic growth seemed likely to slow over coming quarters, but that the easing action taken at the meeting--combined with the 50 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate at the September meeting--should help to promote moderate growth over time, although some downside risks to growth would remain.

      " However, indicators of future spending in this sector pointed to a slowdown in coming months, with a decline in architectural billings, a rise in retail-sector vacancy rates, and survey reports that contractors were experiencing more difficulty in obtaining funding. The U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in October and then more substantially in November, as increases in imports in both months more than offset increases in exports. Non-oil goods imports were boosted by a large increase in imports of consumer goods and small increases in several other categories, which more than offset a steep decline in imports of non-oil industrial supplies. In Japan, the estimate of real GDP growth in the third quarter was revised down, and business sentiment declined in December amidst concerns about high oil prices. With single-family permits and starts still falling, sales of new homes dropping precipitously, sales of existing homes flat, and inventories of unsold homes remaining elevated even in the face of falling house prices, several participants noted the absence of signs of stabilization in the sector. The latter probably reflected at least in part increased uncertainty--inflation risk--rather than greater inflation expectations; increases in nominal wages did not appear to be incorporating higher inflation expectations. Given the policy tradeoffs confronting the FOMC at this time, Mr. Fisher saw the upside risks to inflation as being greater than the downside risks to longer-term economic growth, especially in light of the recent, aggressive easing of monetary policy and the lag before it would have its full effect on the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The forecast showed real GDP rising at a rate somewhat above the growth rate of its potential in 2009, in response to the impetus from cumulative monetary policy easing, continued strength in net exports, a lessening drag from high oil prices, and a relaxation of financial market strains. However, considerable uncertainty surrounded this forecast, and some participants expressed concern that falling house prices and stresses in financial markets could lead to a more severe and protracted downturn in activity than currently anticipated. Several participants noted that the problems of declining asset values, credit losses, and strained financial market conditions could be quite persistent, restraining credit availability and thus economic activity for a time and having the potential subsequently to delay and damp economic recovery. The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that economic activity had weakened further, reflecting slower growth in consumer spending and softening in the labor market, that financial markets remained under considerable stress, and that the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing market contraction were likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. In light of the sharp further deterioration of some key money and credit markets, and against the backdrop of a weaker economic outlook, meeting participants discussed the potential usefulness and risks of instituting a Term Securities Lending Facility, under which primary dealers would be able to borrow Treasury securities for a term of approximately one month against any collateral eligible for open market operations and the highest-quality private mortgage securities.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The Committee noted, however, that downside risks to growth remained, and indicated that it would act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Conditions in U.S. financial markets improved somewhat, on balance, over the intermeeting period, but strains in some short-term funding markets increased. The forecast showed real GDP expanding at a rate somewhat above its potential in 2009, reflecting the impetus from cumulative monetary policy easing, continued strength in net exports, a gradual lessening in financial market strains, and the waning drag from past increases in energy prices. Although participants anticipated that further improvement in market conditions would occur only slowly and that some backsliding was possible, the generally better state of financial markets had caused participants to mark down the odds that economic activity could be severely disrupted by a further substantial deterioration in the financial environment. The possibility that house prices could decline by more than anticipated, and that the effects of such a decline could be amplified through their impact on financial institutions and financial markets, remained a key source of downside risk to participants' projections for economic growth.Growth in consumer spending appeared to have slowed to a crawl in recent months and consumer sentiment had fallen sharply. The forecast showed real GDP expanding at a rate somewhat above its potential in 2009, reflecting the impetus from cumulative monetary policy easing, continued strength in net exports, a gradual lessening in financial market strains, and the waning drag from past increases in energy prices.\n",

      " Unit labor costs apparently continued to increase at a restrained pace during the second quarter, reflecting only moderate gains in worker compensation and relatively strong productivity performance, with little sign of higher overall inflation passing through to higher worker compensation. Although downside risks to growth remained, they appeared to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations increased. Moreover, broad equity price indexes had declined and borrowing costs for nonfinancial firms had increased, including a recent rise in corporate bond yields across most risk categories. Others, however, thought that the extent of such adverse effects was likely to be limited, noting that bank lending had continued to grow at a moderate pace and that consumption and business capital spending had increased in the second quarter despite the tightening of credit terms. Although measures of core inflation might well edge up later this year, given the pass-through to final goods prices of earlier increases in the prices of energy and other inputs, most participants anticipated that core inflation would edge back down during 2009. However, others viewed these risks as having increased, particularly in light of continued elevated readings on headline inflation, the low level of the real federal funds rate, anecdotal information suggesting that firms were having more success in passing higher costs on to their customers, and some signs of an upward drift over recent months in investors' expectations and uncertainty regarding inflation over the longer run; moreover, the recent decline in energy prices might well be reversed in coming months.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Real GDP growth was expected to pick up to slightly above the rate of potential growth in 2010, as the restraint on household and business spending associated with financial market turmoil gradually eases and the contraction in the housing sector comes to an end. However, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and market concerns about other financial institutions were causing a wide variety of financial firms to experience increasing difficulty in obtaining funding and raising capital, a development that was likely to lead to a further tightening of credit availability to households and firms. The fall in employment in August highlighted concerns that an adverse dynamic was taking hold, in which economic weakness increased financial firms' losses, leading to tighter credit conditions and thus causing a further softening in economic activity. Inflation risks appeared to have diminished in response to the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, the recent strengthening of the dollar, and the outlook for somewhat greater economic slack, and Committee members were a bit more optimistic that inflation would moderate in coming quarters. With substantial downside risks to growth and persisting upside risks to inflation, members judged that leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this time suitably balanced the risks to the outlook. Indeed, it was noted that, with elevated inflation still a concern and growth expected to pick up next year if financial strains diminish, the Committee should also remain prepared to reverse the policy easing put in place over the past year in a timely fashion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  In the discussion of System open market operations over the period, it was noted that reserve management had become more complex as a result of the large provision of reserves associated with the recent expansion of the Federal Reserve's liquidity facilities; in particular, the effective federal funds rate had been persistently below the FOMC's target. Broad equity price indexes declined sharply over the intermeeting period, and option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose well above its previous record high. Participants were concerned that the negative spiral in which financial strains lead to weaker spending, which in turn leads to higher loan losses and a further deterioration in financial conditions, could persist for a while longer. Others, though, saw a risk that if resource utilization remained weak for some time, inflation could fall below levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for promoting price stability and maximum employment, a development that would pose important policy challenges in light of the already-low level of the Committee's federal funds rate target. However, others maintained that the possibility of reduced policy effectiveness and the limited scope for reducing the target further were reasons for a more aggressive policy adjustment; an easing of policy should contribute to a beneficial reduction in some borrowing costs, even if a given rate reduction currently would elicit a smaller effect than in more typical circumstances, and more aggressive easing should reduce the odds of a deflationary outcome.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The steep pace of decline in the production of consumer goods reflected not only cutbacks in motor vehicle assemblies but also drops in the output of other goods, such as appliances, furniture, and products related to home improvement. All told, real GDP was expected to fall much more sharply in the first half of 2009 than previously anticipated, before slowly recovering over the remainder of the year as the stimulus from monetary and assumed fiscal policy actions gained traction and the turmoil in the financial system began to recede. Indeed, the severe ongoing financial market strains, the large reductions in household wealth, and the global nature of the economic slowdown were seen by some participants as suggesting the distinct possibility of a prolonged contraction, although that was not judged to be the most likely outcome. Looking forward, participants agreed that inflationary pressures looked set to moderate further in coming quarters, reflecting recent declines in commodity prices and rising slack in resource markets, and several saw risks that inflation could drop for a time below rates they viewed as most consistent over time with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability. The sharp drops and unusual volatility in the prices of many financial assets since the beginning of the fourth quarter were likely to cause more losses for financial institutions, and a number of participants noted that loan delinquencies were increasing significantly in the consumer sector, adding to pressures on banks' balance sheets and reinforcing banks' cautious lending stance.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, with sales declining even more sharply, the ratio of book-value inventories to sales increased in October and November.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed sharply in November, as a steep decline in imports outweighed a sizable drop in exports. In particular, most participants saw the renewed deterioration in the banking sector's financial condition as posing a significant downside risk to the economic outlook absent additional initiatives to stabilize the banking system.Participants noted that consumers were continuing to cut back expenditures in response to sharply declining employment, further declines in wealth, and tighter credit conditions. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.

      "----------------------\n",
      " Large declines in equity prices, a further drop in house prices, and mounting job losses threatened to further depress consumer spending, despite some firming in the recent retail sales data and forthcoming tax reductions. Others, who saw recovery as delayed and potentially weak, were concerned about a possible further rise in the saving rate and a very slow improvement in financial conditions. Such purchases would provide further monetary stimulus to help address the very weak economic outlook and reduce the risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster longer-term economic growth and price stability. To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200 billion. While several participants expressed some concern that the expansion of the TALF program could increase the Federal Reserve's exposure to credit risk, the program's requirements for highly rated collateral that would exceed the value of the related loans, in combination with the added TARP funds as a backstop against losses, were generally seen as providing the Federal Reserve with adequate protection.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although sales remained quite modest, they were enough, given the very slow pace of production, to pare the overhang of unsold new single-family houses: In June, these inventories stood at about one-half of their peak in the summer of 2006, and the months' supply of new homes was down considerably from its record high in January. But this negative influence on aggregate demand was roughly offset by other factors, including higher household net worth as a result of the rise in equity prices since March, lower corporate bond rates and spreads, a lower dollar, and a stronger forecast for foreign economic activity. Reports from business contacts supported the view that firms were making progress in bringing inventories into better alignment with their reduced sales and that production was stabilizing in many sectors--albeit at low levels--and beginning to rise in some. Moreover, declines in employment and weakness in growth of labor compensation meant that income growth was sluggish. Moreover, long-term unemployment and permanent separations continued to rise, suggesting possible problems of skill loss and a need for labor reallocation that could slow recovery in employment as the economy begins to expand. The unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek, combined with indications from business contacts that firms would resist hiring as sales and production turn up, also pointed to a period of modest job gains and thus a slow decline in the unemployment rate.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Despite the upturn in consumer spending, the fundamentals for this sector remained weak: Wages and salaries dropped, house prices were markedly lower than a year ago, and, despite recent increases, equity prices were down substantially from their levels of 12 months earlier. As measured by the Reuters/University of Michigan survey, consumer sentiment strengthened a bit in early April, as households expressed somewhat more optimism about long-term economic conditions; however, even with this improvement, the measure was only slightly above the historical low for the series recorded last November. Measures of volatility and financial stress moved down and risk spreads narrowed in many markets, perhaps partly because of investors' perceptions of diminished downside tail risks. Also, empirical analysis of past episodes in the United States and abroad in which economic downturns had been triggered by financial crises generally concluded that such contractions tended to be more severe and protracted than other recessions. Most participants expected inflation to remain subdued over the next few years, and they saw some risk that elevated unemployment and low capacity utilization could cause inflation to remain persistently below the rates that they judged as most consistent with sustainable economic growth and price stability. Nonetheless, recent monthly readings on consumer price inflation had been above the low rates observed late last year, and survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations had remained reasonably stable, leading many participants to judge that the risk of a protracted period of deflation had diminished.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The fundamental determinants of consumer demand appeared to have improved a bit: Despite the ongoing decline in employment, real disposable personal income rose in the first quarter and posted another sizable gain in April as various provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 boosted transfer payments and reduced personal taxes. These moves likely reflected a number of factors, including investors' perceptions of an improvement in the economic outlook, decreased concerns about the risk of deflation, a reversal of flight-to-quality flows, and selling of long-duration assets as exposure to mortgage prepayment risk dropped with a rise in mortgage rates. Nearly all the BHCs evaluated had enough Tier 1 capital to absorb the higher losses envisioned under the hypothetical more adverse scenario; however, 10 institutions were required to enhance their capital structure to put greater emphasis on common equity. Household wealth was higher, corporate bond rates had fallen, the value of the dollar was lower, the outlook for foreign activity was better, and financial stress appeared to have eased somewhat more than had been anticipated in the staff forecast prepared for the prior FOMC meeting. Although some improvements were evident in new and continuing unemployment insurance claims and the May payroll report was less weak than expected, job losses remained substantial over the intermeeting period and the unemployment rate continued to rise rapidly. A few participants were concerned that inflation expectations could continue to rise, especially in light of the Federal Reserve's greatly expanded balance sheet and the associated large volume of reserves in the banking system, and that as a result inflation could temporarily rise above levels consistent with the Committee's dual objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Even though the upward revision to the projection for output was expected to generate larger gains in employment than previously forecast, the staff still projected only a slow improvement in labor markets, with the unemployment rate moving down to about 9 1/4 percent by the end of 2010 and then falling to about 8 percent by the end of 2011. A number of factors were expected to support growth over the next few quarters: Activity in the housing sector was evidently rising, and house prices had apparently stabilized or even increased; consumer spending seemed to be in the process of leveling out; reports from business contacts and regional surveys were consistent with firms making progress in bringing inventories into better alignment with sales and with production stabilizing or beginning to rise in many sectors; the outlook for growth abroad had also improved, auguring well for U.S. exports; and financial market conditions had continued to improve over the past several months. In any event, the ongoing improvement in broader financial and economic conditions seemed to some participants to reflect the onset of a positive feedback loop in which better financial conditions contribute to stronger growth in output and employment, which in turn bolsters expected returns and strengthens financial firms, leading to a further easing in financial conditions. The unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons, the unusually low level of the average workweek, and indications from business contacts that firms would be slow to hire additional staff as sales and production turn up all pointed to a period of modest job gains, and thus only a slow decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeds.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A number of factors were expected to support near-term growth: Business inventories were being brought into better alignment with sales, and the pace of inventory runoff was slowing; activity in the housing sector appeared to be turning up, and house prices seemed to be leveling out or beginning to rise by some measures; consumer spending appeared to be rising even apart from the effects of fiscal incentives to purchase autos; the outlook for growth abroad had improved since earlier in the year, auguring well for U.S. exports; and U.S. and global financial market conditions, while roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period, were substantially better than earlier in the year. Nonetheless, economic growth was expected to strengthen during the next two years as housing construction continued to rise and financial conditions improved further, leading to more-substantial increases in resource utilization in product and labor markets.Most participants now viewed the risks to their growth forecasts as being roughly balanced rather than tilted to the downside, but uncertainty surrounding these forecasts was still viewed as quite elevated. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Shipments of transportation and high-tech equipment remained strong in October, but shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding those categories declined, and new orders fell sharply across a range of products. In particular, they noted the risk that improvements in the housing sector might be undercut next year as the Federal Reserve's purchases of MBS wind down, the homebuyer tax credits expire, and foreclosures and distress sales continue. Though the near-term outlook remains uncertain, participants generally thought the most likely outcome was that economic growth would gradually strengthen over the next two years as financial conditions improved further, leading to more-substantial increases in resource utilization. The unemployment rate was not the only indicator pointing to substantial slack in labor markets: The employment-to-population ratio had fallen to a 25-year low, and aggregate hours of production workers had dropped more than during the 1981-82 recession. A few members noted that resource slack was expected to diminish only slowly and observed that it might become desirable at some point in the future to provide more policy stimulus by expanding the planned scale of the Committee's large-scale asset purchases and continuing them beyond the first quarter, especially if the outlook for economic growth were to weaken or if mortgage market functioning were to deteriorate. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Inflation compensation based on 5-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) increased; the increase likely reflected higher inflation risk premiums and a further improvement in TIPS market liquidity, along with some rise in inflation expectations owing, in part, to increases in oil prices. Some noted the risk that, with output well below potential over the next couple of years, inflation could edge further below the rates they judged most consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability; others, focusing on risks to inflation expectations and the challenge of removing monetary accommodation in a timely manner, saw inflation risks as tilted toward the upside, especially in the medium term. The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force. If that effect were large--some estimates suggested it could account for 1 percentage point or more of the increase in the unemployment rate during this recession--then the reported unemployment rate might be overstating the amount of slack in resource utilization relative to past periods of high unemployment. In recent months, economic and financial conditions improved steadily, and Mr. Hoenig was concerned that, under these improving conditions, maintaining short-term interest rates near zero for an extended period of time would lay the groundwork for future financial imbalances and risk an increase in inflation expectations.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Real spending on equipment and software increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of 2009 and apparently rose further early in the first quarter of 2010. Business outlays for motor vehicles seemed to be holding up after a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, purchases of high-tech equipment appeared to be rising briskly, and incoming data pointed to some firming in outlays on other equipment. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index dropped back to post-crisis lows after increasing earlier in the period on concerns about Chinese monetary policy tightening and fiscal strains in Europe. Despite low and stable spreads on consumer asset-backed securities (ABS), the amount of ABS issued in the first two months of the year was somewhat below that in the fourth quarter, reflecting the very weak pace of consumer credit originations late last year. However, the dollar declined against most emerging market currencies, which were buoyed by brightening growth prospects, leaving the broad trade-weighted value of the dollar down a bit since the January meeting. A few members also noted that at the current juncture the risks of an early start to policy tightening exceeded those associated with a later start, because the Committee could be flexible in adjusting the magnitude and pace of tightening in response to evolving economic circumstances; in contrast, its capacity for providing further stimulus through conventional monetary policy easing continued to be constrained by the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In their view, a relatively brisk pace of sales would reduce the chance that the elevated size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the associated high level of reserve balances could raise inflation expectations and inflation beyond levels consistent with price stability or could generate excessive growth of credit when the economy and banking system recover more fully. Investment in high-tech equipment and transportation advanced further, and real spending for equipment other than high-tech and transportation appeared to turn up sharply after falling for more than a year, suggesting that the recovery in equipment and software investment became more broadly based. Others, however, saw the balance of risks as pointing to potentially higher inflation and cited pressures on commodity and energy prices associated with expanding global economic activity as an upside inflation risk; some also noted the possibility that inflation expectations could rise as a result of the public's concerns about the extraordinary size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in a period of very large federal budget deficits. While survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been fairly stable, some market-based measures of inflation expectations and inflation risk suggested increased concern among market partici-pants about higher inflation. As at previous meetings, a few members noted that at the current juncture, the risks of an early start to policy tightening exceeded those associated with a later start, because the scope for more accommodative policy was limited by the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate, while the Committee could be flexible in adjusting the magnitude and pace of tightening in response to evolving economic circumstances.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The recovery in equipment and software spending was consistent with the relatively strong gains in production in recent months, improved financial conditions over the first part of the year, and the positive readings from surveys on business conditions and earnings reports for producers of capital goods. The intensifying concerns among investors about the implications of the fiscal difficulties faced by some European countries contributed to an increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a drop in equity prices, which seemed likely to damp somewhat the expansion of domestic demand. In part as a result of the change in financial conditions, most participants revised down slightly their outlook for economic growth, and about one-half of the participants judged the balance of risks to growth as having moved to the downside. Going forward, consumption spending was expected to continue to post moderate gains, with the effects of income growth and improved confidence as the economy recovers more than offsetting the effects of lower stock prices and housing wealth. Indeed, data for the most recent month suggested that, with the expiration of those provisions, home sales and starts had stepped down noticeably and could remain weak in the near term; with lower demand and a continuing supply of foreclosed houses coming to market, participants judged that house prices were likely to remain flat or decline somewhat further in the near term. Participants also noted a risk that continued rapid growth in productivity, though clearly beneficial in the longer term, could in the near term act to moderate growth in the demand for labor and thus slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalizes.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Conditions in financial markets had become somewhat more supportive of growth over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting perceptions of diminished risk of financial dislocations in Europe: Medium- and longer-term interest rates had fallen, some risk spreads had narrowed, and the decline in equity prices that had occurred in the months before the Committee's June meeting had been partly reversed. On the other hand, the revised data might signify that households are seeking to raise their net worth more substantially than previously understood, or to build greater precautionary balances in what they perceive to be a more uncertain economic environment, with the result that growth in consumer spending could remain restrained for some time. Other participants, while agreeing that such factors could restrain job growth and contribute to high rates of unemployment, noted that employment was lower than a year earlier and that job openings were only slightly above their lowest level in 10 years, indicating that few firms saw a need to add employees. Many policymakers judged that downside risks to the U.S. recovery had become somewhat larger; a few saw the incoming data as suggesting a greater risk that private demand for goods and services might not grow enough to offset waning fiscal stimulus and a smaller impetus from inventory restocking. Members still saw the economic expansion continuing, and most believed that inflation was likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward levels they consider more consistent with the Committee's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Among the advanced foreign economies, Europe posted a notable rise in economic activity in the second quarter; rapid expansion in Germany more than offset weaker outcomes in other euro-area economies, particularly those experiencing financial stress related to concerns about their fiscal situations and potential vulnerabilities in their banking sectors. Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time. Participants discussed the possible extent to which the unemployment rate was being boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of the workers who had lost their jobs and the skills needed in the sectors of the economy with vacancies, the inability of the unemployed to relocate because their homes were worth less than their mortgages, and the effects of extended unemployment benefits. Nevertheless, many participants saw evidence that the current unemployment rate was considerably above levels that could be explained by structural factors alone, pointing, for example, to declines in employment across a wide range of industries during the recession, job vacancy rates that were relatively low, and reports that weak demand for goods and services remained a key reason why firms were adding employees only slowly. Mr. Hoenig also emphasized that, in his view, the current high levels of unemployment were not caused by high interest rates but by an extended period of exceptionally low rates earlier in the decade that contributed to the housing bubble and subsequent collapse and recession.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Spreads relative to German bunds on the 10-year sovereign bonds of most peripheral euro-area countries either declined or were little changed over the period, but Irish sovereign spreads moved higher on concerns over the fiscal burdens associated with losses in the Irish banking sector. Although participants considered it quite unlikely that the economy would slide back into recession, some noted that continued slow growth and high levels of resource slack could leave the economic expansion vulnerable to negative shocks. Participants agreed that progress in reducing unemployment was disappointing; indeed, several noted that the recent rate of output growth, if continued, would more likely be associated with an increase than a decrease in the unemployment rate. Participants again discussed the extent to which employment was being held down, and the unemployment rate boosted, by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of the workers who had lost their jobs and the skills needed in the sectors of the economy with vacancies, the inability of the unemployed to relocate because their homes were worth less than the principal they owed on their mortgages, and the effects of extended unemployment benefits on the duration of unemployed workers' search for a new job. Many participants saw evidence that the current unemployment rate was well above levels that could be explained by structural factors alone, noting, for example, reports from business contacts indicating that weak growth in demand for their firms' products remained a key reason why they were reluctant to add employees, and job vacancy rates that were low relative to historical experience.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " On net, the dollar ended the intermeeting period up against most currencies, with particularly large gains against the euro. As a result, although the staff projection showed a higher level of real GDP, the average pace of growth over 2011 and 2012 was little changed from the November forecast, and the unemployment rate was still projected to decline slowly. Moreover, the recovery remained subject to some downside risks, such as the possibility of a more extended period of weak activity and lower prices in the housing sector and potential financial and economic spillovers if the banking and sovereign debt problems in Europe were to worsen. Participants pointed to a number of factors that appeared to have contributed to the significant backup in yields, including an apparent downward reassessment by investors of the likely ultimate size of the Federal Reserve's asset-purchase program, economic data that were seen as suggesting an improved economic outlook, and the announcement of a package of fiscal measures that was expected to bolster economic growth and increase the deficit over coming quarters. Regarding their overall outlook for economic activity, participants generally agreed that, even with the positive news received over the intermeeting period, the most likely outcome was a gradual pickup in growth with slow progress toward maximum employment. One member dissented from the Committee's policy decision, judging that, in light of the improving economy, a continued high level of monetary accommodation would increase the risks of future economic and financial imbalances.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period. After declining in October, nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in November, and the level of new orders remained above the level of shipments, indicating that the backlog of unfilled orders was still rising. Compared with the December forecast, the conditioning assumptions underlying the forecast were little changed and roughly offsetting: Although higher equity prices and a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to be slightly more supportive of economic growth, the staff anticipated that these influences would be about offset by lower house prices and higher oil prices. Most participants continued to anticipate that the recovery in economic activity was likely to be restrained by a variety of economic factors, including still-high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, high rates of mortgage foreclosure, elevated inventories of unsold homes, and tight credit conditions in a number of sectors. Most participants saw the large degree of resource slack in the economy as likely to remain a force restraining inflation, and while the risk of further disinflation had declined, a number of participants cited concerns that inflation was below its mandate-consistent level and was expected to remain so for some time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The price index for PCE excluding food and energy (the core PCE price index) rose slightly in January, boosted by an uptick in prices of core goods after four months of declines; the 12-month change in this core price index stayed near the very low levels seen in late 2010. Changes to the conditioning assumptions underlying the staff projection were mostly small and offsetting: Crude oil prices had risen sharply and federal fiscal policy seemed likely to be marginally more restrictive than the staff had judged in January, but these negative factors were counterbalanced by higher household net worth and a slightly lower foreign exchange value of the dollar. Nonetheless, participants observed that rapidly rising commodity prices posed upside risks to the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, and thus to the outlook for inflation, even as they posed downside risks to the outlook for growth in consumer spending and business investment. Business contacts in a number of regions reported they were more confident about the recovery; a growing number of contacts indicated they were planning for an expansion in hiring and production to meet an anticipated rise in sales. Several participants noted that the drop in unemployment was attributable more to people withdrawing from the labor force and to fewer layoffs than to increased hiring. A few participants expressed concern that the easing of credit conditions in some sectors was becoming or might become excessive as investors took on more risk in order to obtain higher yields.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, in principle, the Committee could accomplish essentially the same degree of monetary tightening by selling assets sooner and faster but raising the target for the federal funds rate later and more slowly, or by selling assets later and more slowly but increasing the federal funds rate target sooner and faster. Participants discussed whether the significant drop in the unemployment rate might be overstating the degree of improvement in labor markets because many of the unemployed have dropped out of the labor force or have accepted jobs that are less desirable than their former jobs. A few participants expressed concern that the easing of credit conditions was creating incentives for increased leverage and risk-taking in some areas, such as leveraged syndicated loans and loans to finance land acquisition, and that this trend, if it became widespread and excessive, could pose a risk to financial stability. Many participants had become more concerned about the upside risks to the inflation outlook, including the possibilities that oil prices might continue to rise, that there might be greater pass-through of higher commodity costs into broader price measures, and that elevated overall inflation caused by higher energy and other commodity prices could lead to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations. These downside risks included a larger-than-expected drag on household and business spending from higher energy prices, continued fiscal strains in Europe, larger-than-anticipated effects from supply disruptions in the aftermath of the disaster in Japan, continuing fiscal adjustments at all levels of government in the United States, financial disruptions that would be associated with a failure to increase the federal debt limit, and the possibility that the economic weakness in the first quarter was signaling less underlying momentum going forward.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " This judgment reflected the persistent weakness in the housing market, the ongoing efforts by some households to reduce debt burdens, the recent sluggish growth of income and consumption, the fiscal contraction at all levels of government, and the effects of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and future tax and regulatory policies on the willingness of firms to hire and invest. Moreover, the recovery remained subject to some downside risks, such as the possibility of a more extended period of weak activity and declining prices in the housing sector, the chance of a larger-than-expected near-term fiscal tightening, and potential financial and economic spillovers if the situation in peripheral Europe were to deteriorate further. Several participants reported feedback from business contacts who were delaying hiring until the economic and regulatory outlook became more certain and who indicated that they expected to meet any near-term increase in the demand for their products without boosting employment; these participants noted the risk that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized. In identifying possible risks to financial stability, a few participants expressed concern that credit conditions in some sectors--most notably the agriculture sector--might have eased too much amid signs that investors in these markets were aggressively taking on more leverage and risk in order to obtain higher returns. Some participants noted that if economic growth remained too slow to make satisfactory progress toward reducing the unemployment rate and if inflation returned to relatively low levels after the effects of recent transitory shocks dissipated, it would be appropriate to provide additional monetary policy accommodation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  Real business spending on equipment and software rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, reflecting strong increases in outlays for high-tech equipment that more than offset declines in spending in many other equipment categories. At the same time, concerns about fiscal deficits and debt sustainability drove yields on the sovereign debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy to record highs relative to yields on German bunds, although later in the period, spreads fell back somewhat. Participants also discussed the labor force participation rate, and it was noted that extended unemployment benefits could be increasing the measured unemployment rate by encouraging some workers to remain in the labor force longer than they otherwise would have. Those viewing a shift toward more accommodative policy as appropriate generally agreed that a strengthening of the Committee's forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate, by being more explicit about the period over which the Committee expected the federal funds rate to remain exceptionally low, would be a measured response to the deterioration in the outlook over the intermeeting period. The Committee also characterized the economic outlook in terms of its statutory mandate and indicated that it expected the slower pace of economic expansion to result in an unemployment rate that would decline only gradually toward levels consistent with its dual mandate and that it saw the downside risks to the economic outlook as having increased. Although financial markets had been volatile and incoming information on growth and employment had been weaker than anticipated, he believed the statement conveyed an excessively negative assessment of the economy and that it was premature to undertake, or be perceived to signal, further policy accommodation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although the waning of these disruptions seemed to be supporting a rebound in foreign GDP growth in the third quarter, recent indicators suggested only sluggish gains in underlying economic activity. Temporary factors that had contributed to slower growth during the first half of the year had partly reversed, contributing to some rebound in final sales and production, particularly in the manufacturing sector where progress had been made in resolving supply chain disruptions. But stresses in global financial markets, sluggish growth in households' real incomes, and heightened uncertainty about economic prospects seemed to have contributed to lower consumer and business sentiment and to be weighing on economic growth. Contacts reported that slower growth, depressed business confidence, and uncertainty about the economic outlook were restraining hiring as well as capital investment; many also cited uncertainty about regulatory and tax policies as contributing to businesses' reluctance to spend. Participants generally agreed that sluggish job growth and the elevated unemployment rate reflected both weak demand for goods and services and a mismatch between the characteristics of the unemployed and the needs of the employers that currently have jobs available, but they had varying views about the relative importance of these two factors. Several participants argued that broader financial conditions had become less accommodative over the intermeeting period: Risk spreads had widened appreciably, likely reflecting a reduced willingness of investors to bear risk, a weaker outlook for growth in the United States and globally, and greater uncertainty about economic prospects. While they did not anticipate a downturn in economic activity, several remarked that, with growth slow, the recovery was more vulnerable to adverse shocks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " More broadly, a number of participants expressed concern that switching to a new policy framework could heighten uncertainty about future monetary policy, risk unmooring longer-term inflation expectations, or fail to address risks to financial stability. For most of the period, market participants seemed heartened by European leaders' efforts to address the fiscal and financial challenges present in the euro area, although the news late in the period on a possible Greek referendum sent stock prices down sharply. Although participants had revised downward their projections for growth since their previous forecasts in June, they continued to anticipate that economic growth would pick up and the unemployment rate would decline gradually through 2014. Participants noted that global supply chain disruptions associated with the natural disaster in Japan had diminished, and that the prices of energy and some commodities had come down from their recent peaks, easing strains on household budgets and likely contributing to a somewhat stronger pace of consumer spending in recent months. With longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable, the effects of earlier increases in the prices of energy and other commodities continuing to wane, and low levels of resource utilization restraining increases in prices and wages, most participants anticipated that inflation would settle, over coming quarters, at or below levels they judged to be most consistent with their dual mandate. Some participants again warned that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and employment prospects of the unemployed.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In other advanced foreign economies, real GDP in Japan rebounded in the third quarter from the effects of the earthquake in March, and real GDP recovered in Canada as oil production picked up after several months of shutdowns; however, available indicators of manufacturing activity in both of these economies pointed to declines during the fourth quarter. Other factors that were expected to weigh on the pace of economic activity were the slowdown of economic activity abroad, fiscal tightening in the United States, high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses, the weak housing market, and household deleveraging. Several participants observed that the ongoing weakness in the housing market came despite low borrowing rates and government initiatives to resolve problems in the foreclosure process. A number of recent indicators showed some improvement in labor market conditions:  Payroll employment had posted moderate gains for five months, new claims for unemployment insurance had drifted lower, and the unemployment rate had turned down. Others indicated that because part of the recent decline in the jobless rate was associated with a reduction in labor force participation, the drop in the unemployment rate likely overstated the overall improvement in the labor market. Some participants again expressed concern that the persistence of high levels of long-duration unemployment and the underutilization of the workforce could eventually lead to a loss of skills and an erosion of potential output. Although some energy prices had recently increased, many participants judged that the favorable trends in commodity prices might persist in the near term, particularly in light of softer global activity, and one noted that expanded crop production, if realized, would hold down agricultural prices.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A number of factors were seen as likely to restrain the pace of economic expansion, including the slowdown in economic activity abroad, fiscal tightening in the United States, the weak housing market, further household deleveraging, high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses, and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets until the fiscal and banking issues in the euro area are more fully addressed. Participants agreed that recent indicators showed some further gradual improvement in overall labor market conditions: Payroll employment had increased somewhat more rapidly in recent months, new claims for unemployment insurance had trended lower, and the unemployment rate had declined. Very high long-duration unemployment might indicate a mismatch between unemployed workers' skills and employers' needs, suggesting that a substantial part of the increase in unemployment since the beginning of the recession reflected factors other than a shortfall in aggregate demand. A few participants noted that the recent decline in the unemployment rate reflected declining labor force participation in large part, and judged that the decline in the participation rate was likely to be reversed, at least to some extent, as the recovery continues and labor demand picks up. However, a couple of participants were concerned that inflation could rise as the recovery continued and argued that providing additional monetary accommodation, or even maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run, would erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nonetheless, a number of factors continued to be seen as likely to restrain the pace of economic expansion; these included slower growth in some foreign economies, prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, the weak housing market, further household deleveraging, and high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses. While a few participants suggested that recent improvements in labor market conditions and the easing in financial conditions could help lay the groundwork for a strengthening in the pace of household spending, several other participants pointed to factors that would likely restrain consumption: Growth in real disposable income was still sluggish, and consumer sentiment, despite some improvement since last summer, remained weak. In support of that view, various indicators were cited, including aggregate hours, which during the recession had exhibited a decline that was particularly severe by historical standards and remained well below the series' pre-recession peak; the high number of persons working part time for economic reasons; and low ratios of job openings to unemployment and of employment to population. A few participants noted that the crude oil price increases in the latter half of 2010 and the early part of 2011 had been part of a broad-based rise in commodity prices; in contrast, non-energy commodity prices had been more stable of late, which suggested that the recent upward pressure on oil prices was principally due to geopolitical concerns rather than global economic growth. Other participants, however, were worried that inflation pressures could increase as the expansion continued; these participants argued that, particularly in light of the recent rise in oil and gasoline prices, maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run could erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Staff Economic OutlookIn the economic forecast prepared for the April FOMC meeting, the staff revised up slightly its near-term projection for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, reflecting that the unemployment rate was a little lower, the level of overall payroll employment a bit higher, and consumer spending noticeably stronger than the staff had expected at the time of the previous forecast. A number of factors continued to be seen as likely limiting the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth in some foreign economies, prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, slow household income growth, and--notwithstanding some recent signs of improvement--ongoing weakness in the housing market. The decline in labor force participation, which has been sharpest for younger workers, has been a factor in the nearly 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate since last August, a drop that was larger than would have been predicted from the historical relationship between real GDP growth and changes in the unemployment rate. One participant cited research suggesting that about half of the decline in labor force participation had reflected cyclical factors, and thus, as participation picks up, unemployment may decline more slowly in coming quarters compared with the recent pace. Another posited that the strength in payroll job growth in recent months may be a one-time reaction to the sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009 and that future job gains may be somewhat weaker unless the pace of economic growth increases.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In addition, indicators of the conditions of European banks continued to deteriorate: Rating agencies downgraded major banks in Germany, Italy, Spain, and several other European countries; prices of euro-area bank stocks fell sharply; and credit default swap premiums for many euro-area banks increased. With the drag from fiscal policy anticipated to increase next year, the staff projected that the growth rate of real GDP would not materially exceed that of potential output until 2014 when economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment. A number of factors continued to be seen as likely to limit the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth or even contraction in some major foreign economies, ongoing and prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, modest growth in household income, and--despite some recent signs of improvement--continued weakness in the housing sector. However, strains in global financial markets, which stemmed primarily from fiscal and banking concerns in Europe, had become more pronounced over the intermeeting period and continued to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook; the possibility of a sharper-than-anticipated fiscal tightening in the United States also posed a downside risk. Another participant pointed to research showing that, in many countries, inflation is less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack when inflation is already low than when inflation is elevated, and to evidence that firms in the United States have been reluctant to cut nominal wages in recent years, as indications that sizable slack might not cause inflation to decline from its already low level.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although participants generally agreed that improvements in recent years in the capital and liquidity of financial institutions and in the strength of household and business balance sheets have increased the resilience of the economy, some were concerned that at its current pace, the recovery was still vulnerable to adverse shocks. Two participants provided an update on the situation in the agricultural sector in light of the drought in the Midwest:  With crop yields projected to be down markedly and prices rising, livestock producers appeared likely to suffer losses as a result of higher input costs while crop producers would need to rely on higher prices and crop insurance to stabilize their income. Furthermore, members generally attached an unusually high level of uncertainty to their assessments of the economic outlook and continued to judge that the risks to economic growth were tilted to the downside because of strains in financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe as well as the potential for a significant slowdown in global economic growth and for a sharper-than-anticipated fiscal contraction in the United States. Consistent with the concerns expressed by many members about the slow pace of the economic recovery, the downside risks to economic growth, and the considerable slack in resource utilization, the Committee decided that the statement should conclude by indicating that it will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The near-term forecast incorporated a larger negative effect of the drought on farm output in the second half of this year than the staff previously anticipated, but this effect was mostly offset by the staff's expectation of a smaller drag from net exports. Prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone, with potential spillovers to U.S. financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader U.S. economy; a larger-than-expected U.S. fiscal tightening; and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth. A few participants, however, mentioned the possibility that economic growth could be more rapid than currently anticipated, particularly if major sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably or if faster-than-expected advances in the housing sector led to improvements in household balance sheets, increased confidence, and easier credit conditions. A few participants reiterated their view that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the effect of structural factors, including mismatches across and within sectors between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available. It was also suggested that there was an ongoing process of polarization in the labor market, with the share of job opportunities in middle-skill occupations continuing to decline while the shares of low and high skill occupations increased. In particular, they expressed concerns about the risk that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment and the depressed level of labor participation could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and prospects of those without jobs, thereby reducing the longer-run normal level of employment and potential output.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Other participants, however, saw little evidence that the efficacy of asset purchases had declined over time, and a couple of these suggested that the effectiveness of purchases might even have increased more recently, as the easing of credit constraints allowed more borrowers to take advantage of lower interest rates. Several participants suggested that enhanced supervision could serve to limit, at least to some extent, the increased risk-taking associated with a lengthy period of low long-term interest rates, and that effective policy communication or balance sheet management by the Committee could reduce the probability of excessively rapid increases in longer-term rates. Many participants, including some of those who were focused on the increasing risks, expressed the view that continued solid improvement in the outlook for the labor market could prompt the Committee to slow the pace of purchases beginning at some point over the next several meetings, while a few participants suggested that economic conditions would likely justify continuing the program at its current pace at least until late in the year. One member dissented from the Committee's policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Many participants were of the view that adopting quantitative thresholds could, under the right conditions, help the Committee more clearly communicate its thinking about how the likely timing of an eventual increase in the federal funds rate would shift in response to unanticipated changes in economic conditions and the outlook. The dollar rose against the currencies of most advanced economies but declined against the euro and most Asian emerging market currencies. Foreign equity indexes, which generally rose following the September FOMC statement, ended the intermeeting period higher in most markets, although stock prices in the euro area were down on net. After declining significantly between late July and early September, the yield spread of 10-year sovereign debt in Italy over comparable German bunds declined only slightly further over the intermeeting period, and the Spanish sovereign spread edged up. Some participants expressed concern about weaker manufacturing output and new orders in recent months, particularly in capital goods industries, although several pointed out that manufacturers' expectations for future orders and production were more positive. Participants remained concerned about risks to financial markets associated with the situation in the euro area and uncertain U.S. fiscal prospects, but a couple noted that measures of financial market uncertainty were still relatively low. A few participants observed that low interest rates had increased demand for riskier financial products, and a couple of participants saw a risk that holding interest rates low for a prolonged period could lead to financial imbalances and imprudent risk-taking.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to result in only a gradual decline in slack in labor and product markets over the forecast period, and progress in reducing unemployment was expected to be relatively slow. A few participants, observing that low interest rates had increased the demand for riskier financial products, pointed to the possibility that holding interest rates low for a prolonged period could lead to financial imbalances and imprudent risk-taking. While almost all members thought that the asset purchase program begun in September had been effective and supportive of growth, they also generally saw that the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased. In addition, all but one member agreed to replace the date-based guidance with economic thresholds indicating that the exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate would remain appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, if secured funding rates were to increase to high levels in the wake of a natural disaster, the risk of a broader, more systemic disruption to the functioning of asset markets could result. Several participants expressed concern that continuation of only slow job growth and persistently high long-duration unemployment could lead to permanent damage to the labor market. Several participants noted that a very large portfolio of long-duration assets would, under certain circumstances, expose the Federal Reserve to significant capital losses when these holdings were unwound, but others pointed to offsetting factors and one noted that losses would not impede the effective operation of monetary policy. Although members saw strains in global financial markets as having eased somewhat, they continued to see an increase in such strains as well as slower global growth and a greater-than-expected fiscal tightening in the United States as downside risks to the economy. One member dissented from the Committee's policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Employment growth in earlier months had been solid, and more-recent improvements included the further decline in the unemployment rate in March and the gradual progress being made in some other labor market indicators. However, several participants cautioned that the drop in the unemployment rate in the latest month was also accompanied by another reduction in the labor force participation rate; the decline in labor force participation over recent quarters could indicate that the reduction in overall labor market slack had been substantially smaller than suggested by the change in the unemployment rate over that period. One participant cautioned that the emergence of financial imbalances could prove difficult for regulators to identify and address, and that it would be appropriate to adjust monetary policy to help guard against risks to financial stability. Most observed that the outlook for the labor market had shown progress since the program was started in September, but many of these participants indicated that continued progress, more confidence in the outlook, or diminished downside risks would be required before slowing the pace of purchases would become appropriate. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Japanese equity markets also displayed substantial volatility; equity prices fell sharply late in the period and erased the gains that had been registered since early April, when the Bank of Japan announced that it would expand its asset purchases in order to nearly double the size of its balance sheet. While market volatility had increased of late, it was noted that the rise in measured volatility, while noticeable, occurred from a low level, and that a broad index of financial stress remained below average. In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Part of this projected increase in the rate of real GDP growth reflected the staff's expectation that the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy would be smaller in the second half as the pace of reductions in federal government purchases slowed and as the restraint on growth in consumer spending stemming from the higher taxes put in place at the beginning of the year diminished. A few participants expressed concern that a decision to lower the unemployment threshold could potentially lead the public to view the unemployment threshold as a policy variable that could not only be moved down but also up, thereby calling into question the credibility of the thresholds and undermining their effectiveness. In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Following the discussion, the Committee unanimously approved the following resolution: Against a backdrop of higher interest rates in the advanced economies and slowing economic growth in the EMEs, several EME currencies came under downward pressure in August; yields and CDS premiums on EME sovereign debt increased, particularly for those economies experiencing sharp currency depreciations; and investors continued to decrease their holdings in EME mutual funds. The staff still anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP this year would only moderately exceed the growth rate of potential output but continued to forecast that real GDP would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy. While downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market were generally viewed as having diminished, on balance, since last fall, a number of significant risks remained, including those related to the potential economic effects of the sizable increases in interest rates since the spring, ongoing fiscal drag, and the possible fallout from near-term fiscal debates. One possible explanation was that, to the extent the decline in the unemployment rate was primarily driven by a fall in the labor force participation rate and low productivity growth, such a decline might overstate the degree of improvement in broader labor market conditions.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  Foreign economic growth appeared to improve in the third quarter following a sluggish first half, largely reflecting stronger growth estimated for China and a rebound in Mexico from contraction in the previous quarter. The staff anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP this year would be about the same as the growth rate of potential output but continued to project that real GDP would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy. While downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market were generally viewed as having diminished, on balance, since last fall, several significant risks remained, including the uncertain effects of ongoing fiscal drag and of the continuing fiscal debate. The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted to the downside, reflecting concerns that the extent of supply-side damage to the economy since the recession could prove greater than assumed; that the tightening in mortgage rates since last spring could exert greater restraint on the housing recovery than had been projected; that economic and financial stresses in emerging market economies and the euro area could intensify; and that, with the target federal funds rate already near its lower bound, the U.S. economy was not well positioned to weather future adverse shocks. However, the staff viewed the risks around the projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate resulting from adverse developments roughly countered by the possibility that the unemployment rate could continue to fall more than expected, as it had in recent years. A few participants noted the risk that the persistent weakness in labor force participation and low rates of productivity growth might indicate lasting structural economic damage from the financial crisis and ensuing recession. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The pickup was widespread, as the euro area registered a second consecutive quarter of positive economic growth, the Mexican economy bounced back from a second-quarter contraction, and stronger external demand boosted growth in emerging market economies more generally. This acceleration in economic activity was expected to be supported by still-accommodative monetary policy and an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, as well as by increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and continued gains in foreign economic growth. However, one participant expressed concern that longer-term interest rates could rise sharply if market participants' expectations of future monetary policy came to deviate from those of policymakers, as appeared to have happened last summer, while a couple of others argued that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could lead investors to take on excessive risk and so undermine longer-term financial stability. Several participants suggested that risks to financial stability should appear more explicitly in the list of factors that would guide decisions about the federal funds rate once the unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and several participants argued that the forward guidance should give greater emphasis to the Committee's willingness to keep rates low if inflation were to remain persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Several participants indicated that recent economic news, although leading them to mark down somewhat their estimates of economic growth in late 2013 as well as their assessments of likely growth in the first quarter of 2014, had not prompted a significant revision of their projections of moderate economic growth over coming quarters. A few participants proposed adding new language in which the Committee would indicate its willingness to keep rates low if projected inflation remained persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; these participants suggested that the inclusion of this quantitative element in the forward guidance would demonstrate the Committee's commitment to defend its inflation objective from below as well as from above. Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the Committee's commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome. Yet another participant argued that it would be desirable for the statement to describe the Committee's reasons for keeping the federal funds rate at the lower bound when standard policy rules were prescribing that the rate should be increased and noted that one possible reason for doing so is that the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate limits the Committee's scope to provide accommodation in response to adverse shocks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth. However, a number of participants pointed to possible sources of downside risk to growth, including a persistent slowdown in the housing sector or potential international developments, such as a further slowing of growth in China or an increase in geopolitical tensions regarding Russia and Ukraine. A number of them argued that several indicators of labor underutilization--including the low labor force participation rate and the still-elevated rates of longer-duration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons--suggested that there is more slack in the labor market than is captured by the unemployment rate alone. A couple of participants cited other research findings that both short- and long-term unemployment rates exert pressure on wages, with the effects of long-term unemployment increasing as the level of short-term unemployment declines. It was also noted that because inflation was expected to remain well below the Committee's 2 percent objective and the unemployment rate was still above participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, the Committee did not, at present, face a tradeoff between its employment and inflation objectives, and an expansion of aggregate demand would result in further progress relative to both objectives.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by diminishing drag on spending from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth. Among the factors anticipated to support the sustained economic expansion were accommodative monetary policy, diminished drag from fiscal restraint, further gains in household net worth, improving credit conditions for households and businesses, and rising employment and wages. Despite attractive mortgage rates, housing demand was seen as being damped by such factors as restrictive credit conditions, particularly for households with low credit scores; high down payments; or low demand among younger homebuyers, due in part to the burden of student loan debt. Others noted supply constraints, pointing to shortages of lots, low inventories of desirable homes for sale, an overhang of homes associated with foreclosures or seriously delinquent mortgages, or rising construction costs. That improvement was evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate as well as by changes in other indicators, such as solid gains in nonfarm payrolls, a low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, uptrends in quits and job openings, and more positive views of job availability by households. Alternatively, some other participants expressed concern that economic growth over the medium run might be faster than currently expected or that the rate of growth of potential output might be lower than currently expected, calling for a more rapid move to begin raising the federal funds rate in order to avoid significantly overshooting the Committee's unemployment and inflation objectives.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Consumer food price inflation also increased in the second quarter, reflecting the effects of drought and disease on crop and livestock production; however, spot prices for crops moved down in recent weeks, and futures prices pointed to lower prices for livestock in the year ahead. Concerns about one of Portugal's largest banks and about litigation risks facing European banks weighed on European financial markets, prompting yield spreads on peripheral sovereign bonds in the euro area to widen and equity price indexes for European banks to decline. In particular, payroll employment continued to advance at a solid pace, the unemployment rate declined further, industrial production posted steady gains, and readings from business surveys were strong. To reconcile the downward revision to real GDP growth for the first half of year with an unemployment rate that was now closer to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate, the staff lowered its assumed pace of potential output growth this year by more than it marked down GDP growth. Several participants pointed out that the recent drop in the unemployment rate had been associated with progress in reabsorbing the long-term unemployed into jobs and reducing part-time work, suggesting that slack was diminishing and could be reduced further as employment opportunities expanded. Moreover, they were concerned that, despite the improvement in labor market conditions, the new language might be misinterpreted as indicating increased concern about underutilization of labor resources.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The staff still anticipated that the pace of real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 would exceed the growth rate of potential output, supported by continued increases in consumer and business confidence, the further easing of the restraint on spending from changes in fiscal policy, additional improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in foreign economic growth. However, a number of participants noted that economic growth over the medium term might be slower than they expected if foreign economic growth came in weaker than anticipated, structural productivity continued to increase only slowly, or the recovery in residential construction continued to lag. Although the unemployment rate was little changed, participants variously cited positive readings from other indicators, including a decline in longer-term unemployment, the low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, the rise in job openings, and survey reports of increased hiring plans and job availability. They pointed out that if nominal wages did not adjust downward when unemployment was high, pent-up wage deflation could help explain the modest increases in wages so far during the recovery, and wages could rise more rapidly going forward as the unemployment rate continues to decline. While most viewed the risk that inflation would run persistently below 2 percent as having diminished somewhat since earlier in the year, a couple noted the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations might be slightly lower than the Committee's 2 percent objective or that domestic inflation might be held down by persistent disinflation among U.S. trading partners and further appreciation of the dollar.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Even with the slower expansion of economic activity in this projection, real GDP was still expected to rise faster than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by accommodative monetary policy and a further easing of the restraint on spending from changes in fiscal policy; in 2017, real GDP growth was projected to step down toward the rate of potential output growth. Indicators of labor market conditions continued to improve over the intermeeting period, with a further reduction in the unemployment rate, declines in longer-duration unemployment, strong growth in payroll employment, and a low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance. One participant noted that even if the declines reflected lower inflation risk premiums and not a reduction in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take them into account because such a change could reflect increased concerns on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity. At this meeting, a staff presentation discussed three issues related to the existing statement that might warrant elaboration or clarification: whether inflation persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective and inflation similarly persistently above that objective would be regarded as equally undesirable, whether additional information should be provided about the \"balanced approach\" that the Committee takes in promoting its two objectives under circumstances in which these objectives are judged not to be complementary, and how financial stability is linked to the Committee's mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nevertheless, real GDP growth was anticipated to slow in the fourth quarter as both net exports and federal government purchases--important positive contributors to real GDP growth in the third quarter--were anticipated to drop back. Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; participants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish. It was noted that even if the declines in inflation compensation reflected lower inflation risk premiums rather than a reduction in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take them into account because such changes could reflect increased concerns on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity. Many participants regarded the international situation as an important source of downside risks to domestic real activity and employment, particularly if declines in oil prices and the persistence of weak economic growth abroad had a substantial negative effect on global financial markets or if foreign policy responses were insufficient. Several participants, pointing to indicators of consumer and business confidence as well as to the solid record of payroll employment gains in 2014, suggested that the real economy may end up showing more momentum than anticipated, while a few others thought that the boost to domestic spending coming from lower energy prices could turn out to be quite large. Labor market conditions had improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; taken as a whole, labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Labor market conditions improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; participants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish. In addition, it was observed that if capital investment in energy-producing industries slowed significantly, it could damp the overall expansion of economic activity for a period, especially if the slowing took place after most of the positive effects of lower energy prices on growth in household spending had occurred. In addition, a few participants argued that even if the shift down in inflation compensation reflected lower inflation risk premiums rather than reductions in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take that decline into account because it could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity. In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In addition, an earlier tightening would increase the likelihood that the Committee might be forced by adverse economic outcomes to return the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound. Labor market conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; numerous labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, a couple of participants expressed financial stability concerns, and one stressed that more planning was needed to address the potential risks before the Committee decides on the appropriate level of ON RRP capacity at the time of liftoff. Such operations shall: (i) mature no later than July 8, 2015, October 7, 2015, and January 8, 2016, respectively; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of $300 billion outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five basis points above the ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the preannounced size of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the preannounced size of the operation, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers received is greater than the preannounced size of the operation. Labor market conditions continued to improve, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate, and participants judged that underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish. A few participants observed that the absence of a notable pickup in wages might not be a useful yardstick for evaluating the degree of remaining slack because of the long lags between declines in unemployment and the response of wages or uncertainty about trend productivity growth. One of them judged that the low level of inflation compensation could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity, and that it was important not to dismiss this possible interpretation. Labor market conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; a variety of labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources continued to diminish.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " One participant argued for such a step in order to bring the spread up to a level closer to that prevailing prior to the financial crisis, but several participants favored maintaining the current spread at least until the process of policy normalization was well under way and policymakers had considered carefully the potential benefits and costs of such a change. The expansion in economic activity over the medium term was expected to lead to a gradual reduction in resource slack; the unemployment rate was projected to decline slowly and to move a little below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate for a time. Some participants expressed particular concern about this prospect, as their expectations of a moderate expansion of economic activity in the medium term, combined with further improvements in labor market conditions, rested largely on a scenario in which consumer spending grows robustly despite softness in other components of aggregate demand. Another participant argued that low values for market-based measures of inflation compensation should concern policymakers, on the grounds that these low values reflected investors placing at least some likelihood on adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity. One of these participants noted, in particular, that a decision to raise the Committee's longer-run inflation objective might work against the achievement of maximum employment and price stability because such a change could undermine the Committee's credibility and, in addition, lead to adverse changes in inflation dynamics that could pose significant challenges for policymakers.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The pace of job gains had been solid and the unemployment rate had declined, with a range of labor market indicators suggesting that underutilization of labor resources had continued to diminish. Overall, most contacts viewed the recent slowdown in manufacturing as likely to prove temporary and remained optimistic about future demand, even though the recent decreases in oil prices and the possibility of adverse spillovers from slower economic growth in China raised some concerns. Participants agreed that labor market conditions had improved further, citing increases in payroll employment and job openings, the decrease in the unemployment rate, and some further reduction in broader measures of labor market underutilization. However, several participants contended that, despite the progress over the past few years, some noticeable margins of slack remained, citing as evidence the high number of workers not actively searching for jobs but available and interested in work as well as the high share of employees working part time for economic reasons compared with pre-recession levels. Another concern related to the risk of premature policy tightening was the limited ability of monetary policy to offset downside shocks to inflation and economic activity when the federal funds rate was near its effective lower bound. The Committee updated the statement to indicate that economic activity had been expanding moderately in recent months and that it had seen further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, pointing specifically to solid job gains and declining unemployment. The Committee also modified the discussion of inflation developments slightly to recognize the more recent declines in energy prices while restating the expectation that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " While the dollar declined against the euro and other European currencies, it rose against the Canadian dollar, the yen, and many emerging market currencies, boosted in part by the strong U.S. employment report for May. Moreover, a number of fundamental factors determining consumer spending remained positive, including the boost to real income from the earlier decline in energy prices, low interest rates, sustained moderate gains in wage and salary income, stronger household balance sheets, and the high levels of households' confidence about the economic outlook and about their income prospects. However, others remained concerned that consumers had not increased their spending as much as expected in response to the drop in energy prices, and that the rise in the saving rate since last fall may signal more cautious behavior among households that might last for some time. They generally agreed that labor market conditions had improved somewhat over the intermeeting period, variously citing solid increases in payroll employment and job openings; low levels of unemployment insurance claims; and, despite an unchanged unemployment rate, some further reduction in broader measures of underutilization, particularly among those not actively searching for jobs, but available and interested in work. However, some members were more uncertain about the extent of progress in the labor market to date or were concerned that if the pace of economic growth remained slow, labor market conditions might improve only gradually.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A smaller gap might increase the frequency of episodes in which policymakers would not be able to reduce the federal funds rate enough to promote a strong economic recovery and rapid return to maximum employment or to maintain price stability in the aftermath of negative shocks to aggregate demand. They discussed whether the slowdown in job gains was merely transitory or indicative of a more persistent slowdown in which labor market conditions might no longer improve. Moreover, several participants indicated that they viewed the pace of monthly job gains in September as still above the rate consistent with stable or declining labor market slack, and a few participants interpreted slower increases in payrolls as evidence that labor markets had tightened. Participants commented on issues related to financial stability monitoring and the use of macroprudential tools, the assessment of valuation risks in leveraged loan and real estate markets, the widening of credit spreads on corporate bonds, and potential risks to financial stability stemming from interest rates remaining low for a prolonged period in an environment of a low neutral (or equilibrium) real rate. They also noted uncertainty about whether economic growth was robust enough to withstand potential adverse shocks, given the limited ability of monetary policy to offset such shocks when the federal funds rate is near its effective lower bound, and concern that the beginning of policy normalization might be associated with an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions. In addition, a couple of participants cited concerns that a premature tightening might damage the credibility of the Committee's inflation objective if inflation stayed below 2 percent for a prolonged period.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, if substantial adverse shocks occurred, continuing reinvestment until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way could help avoid situations that would warrant a larger reduction in the federal funds rate than perhaps could be accomplished given the constraint posed by the effective lower bound to nominal interest rates. Over the intermeeting period, the concerns about global economic growth and turbulence in financial markets led to greater uncertainty among market participants about the likely timing of the start of the normalization of the stance of U.S. monetary policy. The dollar also strongly appreciated against the currencies of most emerging market economies, as most Asian currencies weakened against the dollar following a depreciation of the Chinese renminbi, and as the currencies of commodity exporters fell along with declining commodity prices. Underutilization of labor resources had diminished along a number of dimensions: The unemployment rate had fallen to a level close to most participants' estimates of its longer-run normal rate, and the numbers of discouraged workers and those employed part time for economic reasons had moved lower. However, it was noted that the decline seemed to be related to the further drop in oil prices or may importantly reflect shifts in risk and liquidity premiums, and thus may not signal additional broad and persistent downward price pressures. For example, a significant delay risked an undesired buildup of inflationary pressures or economic and financial imbalances that would be costly to unwind and that eventually could have adverse consequences for economic growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Many expressed the view that the risks to the global economy that emerged late this summer had receded and anticipated moderate improvement in economic growth abroad in the coming year as currency and commodity markets stabilized. However, participants cited a number of lingering concerns, including the possibility that further dollar appreciation and persistent weakness in commodity prices could increase the stress on emerging market economies and that China could find it difficult to navigate the cyclical and structural changes under way in its economy. Moreover, with margins of resource underutilization having already diminished appreciably and longer-run inflation expectations reasonably stable, most anticipated that tightening resource utilization over the next year would contribute to higher inflation. Although almost all still expected that the downward pressure on inflation from energy and commodity prices would be transitory, many viewed the persistent weakness in those prices as adding uncertainty or posing important downside risks to the inflation outlook. In particular, some participants stressed the importance of the pace of economic growth staying above that of potential output in order to reduce remaining labor underutilization across broader dimensions--for example, by lowering the still-elevated numbers of workers employed part time for economic reasons and by encouraging additional workers who are currently outside the labor force but want a job to reenter the labor force. Among those risks was the possibility that additional downward shocks to prices of oil and other commodities or a sustained rise in the exchange value of the dollar could delay or diminish the expected upturn in inflation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were lower in September than around the start of the year, while the rate for Asians was roughly flat this year; the unemployment rates for each of these groups were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved back down to a low level by late October after rising in September following the hurricanes. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its longer-run potential. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions. They cautioned that waiting too long to remove accommodation, or removing accommodation too slowly, could result in a substantial overshoot of the maximum sustainable level of employment that would likely be costly to reverse or could lead to increased risks to financial stability. A few participants cautioned that further increases in the target range for the federal funds rate while inflation remained persistently below 2 percent could unduly depress inflation expectations or lead the public to question the Committee's commitment to its longer-run inflation objective.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rates for Hispanics, for Asians, and for whites were lower in November than two months earlier, while the rate for African Americans was a little higher; the unemployment rates for each of these groups were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential. Several of them expressed concern that persistently weak inflation may have led to a decline in longer-term inflation expectations; they pointed to low market-based measures of inflation compensation, declines in some survey measures of inflation expectations, or evidence from statistical models suggesting that the underlying trend in inflation had fallen in recent years. Some expressed concern that a possible future inversion of the yield curve, with short-term yields rising above those on longer-term Treasury securities, could portend an economic slowdown, noting that inversions have preceded recessions over the past several decades, or that a protracted yield curve inversion could adversely affect the financial condition of banks and other financial institutions and pose risks to financial stability. Participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  In their comments on the briefings and in their discussion of the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability, FOMC participants noted that more stringent regulatory and supervisory policies implemented since the financial crisis, including enhanced capital and liquidity requirements for some types of financial institutions, had significantly increased the resilience of the financial system to shocks. Nonetheless, participants generally agreed that the Committee should not completely rule out the possibility of using monetary policy to address financial stability risks, particularly in circumstances in which such risks significantly threatened the achievement of its dual mandate and when macroprudential tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mitigating those risks. They saw a risk that a more persistent slowdown in economic growth might be under way, which could hinder further improvement in labor market conditions. Some saw the possibility that, even with real GDP growth remaining relatively slow, the unemployment rate might decline more quickly and inflation might rise a bit more rapidly than expected if productivity growth continued to disappoint in coming quarters while hiring remained strong. U.S. and global financial conditions improved significantly over the intermeeting period, marked by a rise in equity indexes, more positive risk sentiment, and a decline in financial market volatility. Some participants pointed to the risk that the recent weak data on domestic spending could reflect a loss of momentum in the economy that might hinder further gains in the labor market and raise the likelihood that inflation could fail to increase as expected.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Real GDP was projected to rise a little slower in the second half of this year than in the previous forecast and to increase at about the same pace thereafter; the small boosts to real GDP growth implied by a lower assumed path for interest rates and by a slightly stronger trajectory for home values were essentially offset by restraint from higher projected paths for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and for oil prices. While weakness in the drilling and mining sector was attributable to the earlier declines in oil prices, participants identified a variety of potential causes of the broader weakness in investment spending, including a slowdown in corporate profits, concern about prospects for economic growth, heightened uncertainty regarding the future course of domestic regulatory and fiscal policies, and a persistent reluctance on the part of firms to undertake new projects in the wake of the financial crisis. In contrast, some noted that the lower rate of payroll gains could instead be indicative of a broader slowdown in growth of economic activity that was also evidenced by other downbeat labor market indicators, such as a decline in the diffusion indexes of industry payrolls, an increase in the number of workers reporting that they were working part time for economic reasons, or the recent sharp drop in labor force participation. Several of these participants expressed concern that a delay in resuming further gradual increases in the federal funds rate would increase the risks to financial stability or would raise the potential for overshooting the Committee's objectives; such an overshooting might require a rapid removal of policy accommodation at some point in the future, which could entail significant risks for U.S. financial markets and the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Near-term forward spreads on speculative-grade issues dropped substantially more than their far-term forward counterparts, suggesting that the overall decline in speculative-grade spreads was due in part to a less negative credit outlook and not just an increase in investors' risk appetite. The forecast for real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 was little revised, as the positive effects of a slightly lower assumed path for interest rates and a stronger trajectory for household wealth were mostly offset by the restraint from a weaker outlook for foreign GDP growth and a slightly stronger path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar. The unemployment rate rose in June after having declined in May, but the labor force participation rate ticked up, the rate of involuntary part-time employment more than reversed its increase in May, and the broader U-6 measure of labor underutilization continued to move down. With inflation still below the Committee's longer-run objective and likely to continue to respond only slowly to somewhat tighter labor markets, most also saw relatively low risk that a further gradual strengthening of the labor market would generate an unwanted increase in inflationary pressures. They agreed that the strong rebound in job gains in June--together with a rise in the labor force participation rate and a decline in the number of individuals who were working part time for economic reasons--suggested that, despite the very soft employment report for May, labor market conditions remained solid and slack had continued to diminish.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, a few still judged that overall risks were weighted to the downside, citing various factors that included the possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in foreign economies, continued uncertainty associated with Brexit, the proximity of policy interest rates to the effective lower bound, or persistent headwinds to economic growth. Al­though job gains had slowed from their pace in 2015, average monthly increases so far this year had exceeded most estimates discussed by participants of monthly payroll increases that could be expected to prevail with economic growth proceeding at its longer-run trend rate. Al­though several participants indicated that there was uncertainty as to how long the low level of r* would persist, one pointed to a growing consensus that the long period of slow productivity growth and recent evidence that the neutral rate had fallen across countries suggested that r* was likely to remain low for some time. They maintained that a further delay in raising the target range would unduly increase the risk of the unemployment rate falling markedly below its longer-run normal level, necessitating a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation that could shorten the economic expansion. Some of them noted that the increase in the labor force participation rate this year suggested more room for labor supply to expand than previously expected, or contended that the slower progress seen this year in other labor market indicators--such as the unemployment rate, broader measures of labor utilization, job openings and quits, and wage growth--indicated that slack was being taken up at only a modest pace.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Vulnerabilities from leverage in the private nonfinancial sector were seen as moderate overall, reflecting the combination of relatively high aggregate leverage in the corporate sector, a sharp slowdown in the expansion of the riskiest forms of corporate debt, and a continued modest rise in aggregate household debt that accrued almost exclusively to borrowers with very high credit scores. A substantial majority viewed the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, although a few participants judged that significant downside risks remained, citing various factors including the low value of the neutral federal funds rate and its proximity to the effective lower bound, the possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in foreign economies, the continued uncertainty associated with the United Kingdom's exit from the EU, or financial fragilities in some countries. In addition, many judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an extended period of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield, potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital. In contrast, some others judged that allowing the unemployment rate to fall below its longer-run normal level for a time could result in favorable supply-side effects or help hasten the return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective; noted that proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound places potential constraints on monetary policy; or stressed that global developments could pose risks to U.S. economic activity. A few members, however, were concerned that a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate could necessitate a steep subsequent rise in policy rates, undermining the Committee's prior communications about its expectations for a gradually rising policy rate or even posing risks to the economic expansion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Core PCE prices, which exclude food and energy prices, rose about 1-3/4 percent over the same period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy imports over a portion of this period and by the pass-through of earlier declines in energy prices into the prices of other goods and services. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually, on net, and to continue to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate through the end of 2019; the path for the unemployment rate was a little lower than in the previous projection. The downside risks from the possibility that longer‑term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the dollar could appreciate more than anticipated were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential. For some participants, the greater upside risks to economic growth, the upward movement in inflation compensation over recent months, or the possibility of further increases in oil prices had increased the upside risks to their inflation forecasts. Some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax, and regulatory policies, while others were uncertain about the outlook for significant government policy changes or were concerned that their businesses might be adversely affected by some of the proposals under discussion. Over the past year, broad measures of labor underutilization that include both the unemployed and workers marginally attached to the labor force had trended lower, the labor force participation rate had been relatively steady despite downward pressure from demographic trends, and layoffs had fallen to low levels.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rate edged up to 4.7 percent but remained near its recent low, while the labor force participation rate rose slightly. The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession, but the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential. Some participants cited other indicators confirming the strengthening in the labor market, such as a decline in the broader measures of labor underutilization that include workers marginally attached to the labor force, the rise in the quits rate, and faster increases in some measures of labor compensation. Some saw a risk that inflationary pressures might develop more rapidly than currently anticipated as resource utilization tightened, while several others thought that progress in achieving the Committee's inflation objective might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization. These included upside risks such as appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy or a more rapid buildup of inflationary pressures, as well as downside risks associated with a possible further appreciation of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies, together with the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound.\n",

      " The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession, but the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites. Real GDP was expected to expand at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter, reflecting some data for January that were judged to be transitorily weak, but growth was projected to move back up in the second quarter. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential. In addition, conditions conducive to growth in consumer spending, such as a strong labor market or higher levels of household wealth, were expected to persist. Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 210,000 over the three months ending in February, the unemployment rate edged down, and the labor force participation rate ticked up. Notwithstanding these developments, some participants cautioned that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective should not be overstated; they noted that inflation had been persistently below 2 percent during the current economic expansion and that core inflation on a 12-month basis was little changed in recent months at a level below 2 percent.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, but the gain was smaller than in recent months, likely reflecting both warmer-than-usual temperatures in February that probably caused some hiring to be moved forward and a major winter storm in the Northeast in March that probably held down hiring somewhat; nevertheless, the increase in employment for the first quarter as a whole was solid. Indeed, after declining in January and February, real PCE increased in March, partly reflecting a rebound in spending on energy services, which had been held down by unseasonably warm weather through February, as well as an increase in outlays for a variety of consumer goods. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential. While recent data suggested a significant slowdown of growth in consumption spending early in the year, participants expected to see a rebound in consumer spending in coming months in light of the solid fundamentals underpinning household spending, including ongoing job gains, rising household income and wealth, improved household balance sheets, and buoyant consumer sentiment. However, a couple of participants pointed out that uncertainty about both the longer-run normal rate of unemployment and labor force trends made it difficult to assess the scope for additional sustainable increases in labor utilization.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rate moved down to 4.3 percent in May; the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics stepped down but remained above the unemployment rates for Asians and for whites. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential. However, a couple of participants expressed concern that a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment could pose an appreciable upside risk to inflation or give rise to macroeconomic or financial imbalances that eventually could lead to a significant economic downturn. Some participants suggested that increased risk tolerance among investors might be contributing to elevated asset prices more broadly; a few participants expressed concern that subdued market volatility, coupled with a low equity premium, could lead to a buildup of risks to financial stability. Several participants expressed concern that a substantial and sustained unemployment undershooting might make the economy more likely to experience financial instability or could lead to a sharp rise in inflation that would require a rapid policy tightening that, in turn, could raise the risk of an economic downturn. With regard to financial stability, one participant emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant about financial developments but observed that previous episodes of elevated financial imbalances and low unemployment had limited relevance for the present situation, as the current system of financial regulation was likely more robust than that prevailing before the financial crisis.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rate edged up to 4.4 percent in June; the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics declined slightly but remained above the unemployment rates for Asians and for whites. These included a diminished responsiveness of prices to resource pressures, a lower natural rate of unemployment, the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment, lags in the reaction of nominal wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening, and restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models spurred by advances in technology. A couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations; in addition, as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors, these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability. They observed that the Committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further and argued against additional adjustments until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. They cautioned that a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation could result in an overshooting of the Committee's inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse, or that a delay could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Participants also noted that the proposed new language indicating that the Committee would \"be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below\" its 2 percent objective would not require that participants hold similar views about inflation dynamics; in addition, the proposed language would not specify the stance of monetary policy in such circumstances but would afford the Committee appropriate flexibility in tailoring a policy response to persistent deviations from the inflation objective. A couple of others agreed that there were reasons for concerns about deviations above or below the 2 percent objective, but noted that the reasons for, and degree of, those concerns could differ depending upon the direction of the deviation or broader macroeconomic conditions. The staff estimated that the negative effects of a lower projected path for equity prices and a higher assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar would be mostly offset by the positive effects of a lower path for crude oil prices and slightly more stimulus to aggregate demand from changes in fiscal policy than was assumed in the previous forecast. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The short-term disruptions to spending and production associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were expected to reduce real GDP growth in the third quarter and to boost it in the fourth quarter as production returned to its pre-hurricane path and as a portion of the lost spending was made up. Because of continued subdued inflation readings and, given real GDP growth, a larger-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate over much of the past year, the staff revised down slightly its estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment in this projection. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential. A number of participants reported that their business contacts appeared to have become more confident about the economic outlook, and it was noted that the National Federation of Independent Business reported that greater optimism among small businesses had contributed to a sharp increase in the proportion of small firms planning increases in their capital expenditures. Increases in most aggregate measures of hourly wages and labor compensation remained subdued, and several participants commented that the absence of broad-based upward wage pressures suggested that the sustainable rate of unemployment might be lower than they currently estimated. These participants cautioned that an unduly slow pace in removing policy accommodation could result in an overshoot of the Committee's inflation objective in the medium term that would likely be costly to reverse or could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Staff Economic OutlookIn the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP in the first half of the year was projected to increase a little more slowly than in the forecast prepared for the January meeting, although estimated real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was revised up. A range of labor market indicators, including strong employment growth and rising labor force participation, pointed to a further strengthening of the labor market. Participants observed that strong job gains in recent months had reduced concerns about a possible slowing of progress in the labor market. For example, strong expansion of household demand could result in rapid employment growth and overly tight resource utilization, particularly if productivity gains remained sluggish. Broader measures of labor force underutilization had also shown progress, including an increase in labor force participation. Some participants judged that current labor market conditions were at or near those consistent with maximum sustainable employment, noting that the unemployment rate was at or below their estimates of its longer-run normal level and citing anecdotal reports of labor shortages or increased wage pressures. A few others expressed the view that there were also risks that could lead to inflation running higher than anticipated; for example, overly tight resource utilization could push inflation above the Committee's 2 percent goal, particularly if productivity gains remained sluggish. However, most participants, while recognizing the likely positive effects of recent policy actions abroad, saw foreign economic growth as likely to run at a somewhat slower pace than previously expected, a development that probably would further restrain growth in U.S. exports and tend to damp overall aggregate demand.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A few other participants suggested that the FOMC could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the Committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations consistent with the Committee's inflation objective, particularly in an environment in which the neutral rate of interest appeared likely to remain low. Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was revised up, reflecting a reassessment of the recently enacted tax cuts, along with higher projected paths for equity prices and foreign economic growth and a lower assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential. The labor market had strengthened further in recent months, as indicated by continued solid payroll gains, a small increase in average hours worked, and a labor force participation rate that had held steady despite the longer-run declining trend implied by an aging population. While participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer-run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further. Almost all participants continued to anticipate that inflation would move up to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as economic growth remained above trend and the labor market stayed strong; several commented that recent developments had increased their confidence in the outlook for further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. Most participants described labor market conditions as strong, noting that payroll gains had remained well above the pace regarded as consistent with absorbing new labor force entrants over time, the unemployment rate had stayed low, job openings had been high, or that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had been low. Many participants observed that the labor force participation rate had been higher recently than they had expected, helping to keep the unemployment rate flat over the past few months despite strong payroll gains. A few participants warned against inferring too much from comparisons of the current low level of the unemployment rate with historical benchmarks, arguing that the much higher levels of education of today's workforce--and the lower average unemployment rate of more highly educated workers than less educated workers--suggested that the U.S. economy might be able to sustain lower unemployment rates than was the case in the 1950s or 1960s. Contacts in a few Districts suggested that widely known, observable cost increases--such as those associated with rising commodity prices--would be more likely to be accepted and passed through to final goods prices than would less observable costs such as wage increases. A few participants argued that either an absence of pricing power among at least some firms--perhaps stemming from globalization and technological innovations, including ones that facilitate price comparisons--or the ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production has been damping inflationary pressures.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Market participants pointed to a range of factors contributing to the decline in stock prices, including concerns about the outlook for trade policy both in the United States and abroad, the potential for increased regulatory oversight of U.S. technology companies, and incoming data suggesting some moderation in global economic growth. Light motor vehicle sales stepped down in the first quarter after a strong fourth-quarter pace that was partly boosted by replacement sales following the fall hurricanes; sales declined in April, but indicators of vehicle demand remained upbeat. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. They noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above-trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad. With economic growth anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or to decline further below, their estimates of its longer‑run normal rate. In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, a few participants also noted the risk that, if global oil prices remained high or moved higher, U.S. inflation would be boosted by the direct effects and pass-through of higher energy costs. These participants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market conditions and achieving the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt policy tightening.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics all declined, on net, from March to May; the rate for African Americans was the lowest on record but still noticeably above the rates for other groups. The rate of private-sector job openings rose in March and stayed at that elevated level in April; the rate of quits edged up, on net, over those two months; and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low through early June. Over the 2018-20 period, output was projected to rise further above the staff's estimate of its potential, and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast. Some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally agreed that the economic expansion was progressing roughly as anticipated, with real economic activity expanding at a solid rate, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee's objective.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That decline was viewed as likely driven by various factors, including slower trend growth of the labor force and productivity as well as increased demand for safe assets. Over the 2018-20 period, output was projected to rise further above the staff's estimate of potential output, and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff's estimate of the longer-run natural rate. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast. Reports from several Districts suggested that firms had greater scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to strong demand or increases in input costs, including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses. Some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could eventually trigger an economic downturn. Some noted larger or more persistent positive effects of these factors as an upside risk to the outlook. Other downside risks cited included the possibility of a significant weakening in the housing sector, a sharp increase in oil prices, or a severe slowdown in EMEs. Several participants also pointed to the continued strength in business fixed investment, although the persistent weakness and the risk of a further slowdown in residential investment were also noted.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The staff's preliminary assessment was that the effects of Hurricane Florence would lead to a slight reduction in real GDP growth in the third quarter and a small addition to growth in the fourth quarter as economic activity returned to more normal levels and some disrupted activity was made up. In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally characterized consumption growth as strong, and they judged that robust increases in disposable income, high levels of consumer confidence, and solid household balance sheets had contributed to the strength in spending. For example, the higher saving rate may indicate some greater caution on the part of consumers, greater inequality of income and wealth--which would imply a lower aggregate propensity to spend--or changing consumer behavior in a low interest rate environment. The divergence between domestic and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because of the potential for further strengthening of the U.S. dollar; some participants noted that financial stresses in a few EMEs could pose additional risks if they were to spread more broadly through the global economy and financial markets. Tightening resource utilization and an increasing ability of firms to raise output prices were cited as factors that could lead to higher-than-expected inflation, while lower-than-expected growth, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, or inflation expectations persistently running below 2 percent were mentioned as risks that could lead to lower inflation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Participants commented that, by contrast, interest rate control might be difficult to achieve in an operating regime of limited excess reserves in view of the potentially greater unpredictability of reserve demand resulting from liquidity regulations or changes in risk appetite, or the increased variability of factors affecting reserve supply. Participants also observed that regimes with abundant excess reserves could provide effective control of short-term rates even if large amounts of liquidity needed to be added to address liquidity strains or if large-scale asset purchases needed to be undertaken to provide macroeconomic stimulus in situations where short-term rates are at their effective lower bound. A number of participants commented that the attractive features of a regime of abundant excess reserves should be weighed against the potential drawbacks of such a regime as well as the potential benefits of returning to a regime similar to that employed before the financial crisis. Investors pointed to a number of uncertainties in the global outlook that may have contributed to the decline in stock prices, including ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, growing concerns about the fiscal position of the Italian government and its broader implications for financial markets and institutions, and some worries about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Several participants were concerned that the high level of debt in the nonfinancial business sector, and especially the high level of leveraged loans, made the economy more vulnerable to a sharp pullback in credit availability, which could exacerbate the effects of a negative shock on economic activity.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  The staff noted that during the transition to a long-run operating regime with excess reserves below current levels, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) could begin to rise a little above the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate as reserves in the banking system declined gradually to a level that the Committee judges to be most appropriate for efficient and effective implementation of policy. Various factors that could pose downside risks for domestic economic growth and inflation were mentioned, including the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, a more rapid waning of fiscal stimulus, an escalation in trade tensions, a further tightening of financial conditions, or greater-than-anticipated negative effects from the monetary policy tightening to date. With regard to upside risks, participants noted that the effects of fiscal stimulus could turn out to be greater than expected and the uncertainties surrounding trade tensions or the global growth outlook could be resolved favorably, leading to stronger-than-expected economic outcomes, while a couple of participants suggested that tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an increase in the ability of firms to pass through increases in input costs to consumer prices could generate undesirable upward pressure on inflation. With an increase in the target range at this meeting, the federal funds rate would be at or close to the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run neutral interest rate, and participants expressed that recent developments, including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth, made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Market participants pointed to a number of factors as contributing to the heightened volatility and sustained declines in risk asset prices and interest rates over recent months including a weaker outlook and greater uncertainties for foreign economies (particularly for Europe and China), perceptions of greater policy risks, and the partial shutdown of the federal government. A substantial majority expected that when asset redemptions ended, the level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than necessary for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy; if so, many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves, reflecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation, could be appropriate. A few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing reserves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs, such as an undue risk of volatility in short-term interest rates, that would exceed its benefits. In the medium term, real GDP growth in 2019 was forecast to be at a rate above the staff's estimate of potential output growth, step down to the growth rate of potential output next year and then slow further to a pace below potential output growth in 2021. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Several participants preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by resuming purchases of Treasury securities relatively soon after the end of runoff, because they saw little benefit to further declines in reserve balances or because they thought the Committee should minimize the risk of interest rate volatility that could occur if the supply of reserves dropped below a point consistent with efficient and effective implementation of policy. Some others preferred to allow the average level of reserves to continue to decline for a longer time after balance sheet runoff ends because such declines could allow the Committee to learn more about underlying reserve demand, because they judged that such a process was not likely to result in excessive volatility in money market rates, or because they judged that moving to lower levels of reserves was more consistent with the Committee's previous communications indicating that it would hold no more securities than necessary for implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that is still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer‑term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated. In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, near-record levels of job openings and help-wanted postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent months.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property slowed in the first quarter, reflecting both a slower increase in transportation equipment spending after a strong fourth-quarter gain and a decline in spending on other types of equipment outside of high tech. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risks that recent soft data on consumer prices could persist and that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated. Participants noted the unexpected strength in first-quarter GDP growth, but some observed that the composition of growth, with large contributions from inventories and net exports and more modest contributions from consumption and investment, suggested that GDP growth in the near term would likely moderate from its strong pace of last year. Several participants observed that financial conditions and business sentiment had continued to improve, consistent with reports from business contacts in a number of Districts; however, a few others reported less buoyant business sentiment Many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated to some extent. Several participants commented that if inflation did not show signs of moving up over coming quarters, there was a risk that inflation expectations could become anchored at levels below those consistent with the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective—a development that could make it more difficult to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis over the longer run.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly, on average, in April and May; however, job gains slowed sharply in May after a strong increase in April. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics decreased, on net, over April and May and were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained. The rate of private-sector job openings moved up in March and held steady in April, while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through early June was near historically low levels. This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained well below core inflation, and consumer energy price inflation slowed considerably to about the same rate as core inflation. Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021. While strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spending, uncertainties and risks regarding the global outlook appeared to be contributing to a deterioration in risk sentiment in financial markets and a decline in business confidence that pointed to a weaker outlook for business investment in the United States.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " They noted that the inclusion of feedback from the public as part of the review, via the Fed Listens events, had improved the transparency of the review process, enhanced the Federal Reserve's public accountability, and provided insights into the positive implications of strong labor markets and high rates of employment for various communities. These topics included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of the ELB constraint, the role of inflation expectations in monetary policy, the best means of conveying the Committee's balanced approach to monetary policy and the symmetry of its inflation goal, the relationship between the Committee's strategy and its decisions about the settings of its policy tools, the implications of the low value of the neutral policy rate and of uncertainty about the values of the neutral policy rate and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, the potential benefits and costs of unemployment running below its longer-run normal rate in conditions of muted inflation pressures, and the time frame over which policymakers aimed to achieve their dual-mandate goals. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Asians declined in June, the rate for whites was unchanged, and the rate for Hispanics edged up; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained. Several participants favored maintaining the same target range at this meeting, judging that the real economy continued to be in a good place, bolstered by confident consumers, a strong job market, and a low rate of unemployment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In light of a low neutral rate and shortfalls of inflation below the 2 percent objective for several years, some participants raised the concern that the policy space to reduce the federal funds rate in response to future recessions could be compressed further if inflation shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation expectations, a risk that was also discussed in the staff analysis. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics declined over July and August, while the rates for whites and Asians increased; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels of households' net worth, and generally low borrowing rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. With regard to the contrast between robust consumption growth and weak investment growth, several participants mentioned that uncertainties in the business outlook and sustained weak investment could eventually lead to slower hiring, which, in turn, could damp the growth of income and consumption. As their discussion of risks had highlighted, downside risks had become more pronounced since July: Trade uncertainty had increased, prospects for global growth had become more fragile, and various intermeeting developments had intensified geopolitical risks. These participants suggested that a larger policy move would help reduce the risk of an economic downturn and would more appropriately recognize important recent developments, such as slowing job gains, weakening investment, and continued low values of market-based measures of inflation compensation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In particular, several participants emphasized that to guard against the possibility of adverse feedback loops in which forward guidance is interpreted by the public as a sign of a sharply deteriorating economic outlook, thus leading households and businesses to become even more cautious in their spending decisions, the Committee would need to clearly communicate how its announced policy could help promote better economic outcomes. In particular, some participants cautioned that the financial system in the United States is considerably different from those in countries that implemented negative interest rate policies, and that negative rates could have more significant adverse effects on market functioning and financial stability here than abroad. The unemployment rates for Asians, Hispanics, and whites each moved lower in September, but the rate for African Americans was unchanged; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained. In particular, some further signs of a global slowdown in economic growth emerged; weakening in the global economy could further restrain the domestic economy, and the risk that the weakness in domestic business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring and weigh on household spending remained prominent. Al­though financial stability risks overall were seen as moderate, several participants indicated that imbalances in the corporate debt market had grown over the economic expansion and raised the concern that deteriorating credit quality could lead to sharp increases in risk spreads in corporate bond markets; these developments could amplify the effects of an adverse shock to the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Representatives from underserved communities who participated in the Fed Listens events generally saw the current strong labor market as providing significant benefits to their communities, most notably by creating greater opportunities for individuals who have experienced difficulty finding jobs in the past. Event participants were asked about monetary policymakers' concerns regarding overall inflation running persistently below 2 percent; they noted that the Federal Reserve could better communicate its reasons for these concerns. Most participants commented on the large costs that recessions and high unemployment impose on communities, notably on their most vulnerable constituents, and stressed the need for monetary policy to seek to avoid recessions in the first place or reduce their severity when they occur. The unemployment rate ticked up in October but then moved back down to its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in November; the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio held steady, on balance, over those two months. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were little changed, on net, over the past two months; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained. Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022. Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job gains remaining solid, and some measures of labor force participation increasing further.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Some participants remarked, however, that keeping policy rates low to achieve both of the Committee's dual-mandate objectives may contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities, especially at times when the economy is at or above full employment, a development that could pose future risks to the economy and to the ability of the Committee to achieve its dual mandate. However, various participants noted that while these tools could be deployed proactively to lean against the buildup of financial vulnerabilities, they have some limitations in the context of the U.S. financial system, where the few available tools are, for the most part, not designed to address vulnerabilities outside the banking sector. Several participants commented on potential reasons for the absence of stronger broad-based wage pressures, including technological changes that could substitute for labor, increased willingness of employees to forgo wage gains for greater job stability, adjustments in nonwage portions of compensation packages, and the possibility that the labor market was not as tight as the historically low unemployment rate would suggest. Some participants expressed the concern that financial imbalances—including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness—could amplify an adverse shock to the economy, that the current conditions of low interest rates and labor market tightness could increase risks to financial stability, or that cyber attacks could affect the U.S. financial system. Several participants noted that planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in capital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks—which could have negative implications for the economy—or that lower bank capital ratios could be associated with greater tail risks to GDP growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That's basically what concerns me and what veryreadily could end up as the problem if suddenly we find that insteadof slipping back to 3 percent GPD growth, or 2-1/2 percent orsomething like that, the numbers stay up there. And the reason theywould stay up there is the same reason they've always stayed up in abusiness cycle expansion--that inventory accumulation turnsinventory/sales ratios higher, and that's ultimately a source of-44-2/3-4/94business cycle instability. There may not be much there but, as Mike said, thepresumption that inflation is staying down is very hard to maintain.That doesn't necessarily mean anything; I suspect productivity isprobably doing better than we would expect and hence unit labor costsare not going up all that much.In any event, I would put on the table my preference that atthis meeting we move up 25 basis points. The Fed waswrong and had to act more rapidly in order to offset that, so I thinkthat was not a period when the Fed excelled in policymaking.Yes, but there was the expectation thatthere would be fiscal drag, and I think the Fed responded to that.That's not a major issue; I don't want to prolong the discussion but Ihappened to be reading about that episode recently.Well, I've been around a long timewatching markets behave and I will tell you that if we do 50 basispoints today, we have a very high probability of cracking theseeasier for us to start the process with a smaller move. It is veryunlikely that the recent rate of economic growth will not simmer downlargely because some developments involved in this particular periodare clearly one-shot factors--namely, the very dramatic increase inresidential construction and the big increase in motor vehicle sales.Essentially the two of those have added one-shot elements to growth.In the context of a saving rate that is not high, the probability isin the direction of this expansion slowing from its recent pace, whichat the moment is well over 4 percent and, adjusting for weathereffects, may be running over 5 percent.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We are beginning to getthe first signs that the inventory numbers may be moving up, and if-41-3/22/94that's the case, that would maintain a higher level of economic growththan I think we otherwise would have gotten.There is no question that we have cut the tail of theprobability distribution for the economic outlook, even though in amodal sense the outlook itself is not all that much higher than it wassix months ago so far as 1994 is concerned. Now, the next set of numbers may come out and I'll be sorry Isaid this, but the earlier experience raises the question: Is itautomatically the case that when the economy is tightening up thatinflation takes hold?-42-3/22/94I would submit that looking at the simple short-run Phillipscurve, which is what we are doing, without a credit variable in it,shrinkage of credit has basically reflected balance sheet strain inthe latter part of the 1980s and has at the same time been associatedwith extraordinary weakness in all of the aggregates. So the question is, having very consciouslyand purposely tried to break the bubble and upset the markets in orderto sort of break the cocoon of capital gains speculation, we are nowin a position--having done that and in a sense succeeded perhaps morethan we had intended--to try to restore some degree of confidence inthe System. If, however, whollyindependently of our process of going to neutrality, we begin to seethat this economy is not slowing--or more specifically, if we see thatinventories are really beginning to move up, because that's where Ithink the vulnerability is--then we will have a second set ofimplement, which as far as I'm concerned we have to get to, but wewould have an added factor on top of that--an additional tighteningsuperimposed on our move to neutrality because, in effect, we would beseeing an economy that is actually beginning to heat up.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " You have to ask yourself under what conditions you get acoupling of rates for noneconomic reasons, or for reasons other thanthe basic type we usually see.The answer essentially lies in the notion, at least in myhypothesis, that if there is a risk premium out there which isgeneric, its impact will tend to be relatively the same depending noton what currency is involved but whether there is uncertainty aboutlong-term commitments in financial markets and price stability in theincrease in international portfolio holdings of many currencies, thenif you get a major element of uncertainty--for example, if I'm aportfolio manager and I have long commitments in U.S. Treasuries onthe expectation that prices are going to go up, and the markets goagainst me--what has happened is that my whole sense that \"I know whatit's doing\" has collapsed. Slowdowns in promised deliveries have clearly moved up andthat's far more than an issue of the weather in the month of February.So there are the makings here of stronger inventory changes than Ithink we recognize.The most interesting aspect of the economic outlook as I seeit is that this far into the recovery--and it's almost immaterialwhether or not you take Jerry's view that in effect we're only in thefirst year of the recovery--the actual inflation rates, wage rates,and the like are lower than one would ordinarily expect. The chances of our breaking the back of theeconomy at this point--with inventory levels as low as they are,capital goods markets still with significant momentum, and the ordersas strong as they are--have to be pretty low.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I think our public policy posture always has to be in favorof either low or declining unemployment rates or low or declininginflation. If we think in terms of the aggregate amount of dollars growingnot only because of current account deficits and increased claims butmore importantly because of a general grossing up in the Euro-currencyin the search for increased rates of return, but basically that iswhat dominates the system.The reason this is important is that if we get short-termchanges in expectations with respect to how the rate of return isgoing to be altered, we need a very large change in interest rates orrates of return to offset that. In today's environment, that sort of rigid adjustment isvery rarely seen, but I think the principle is fundamentally the same.Any attempt by us to use monetary policy to offset exchange rateeffects has very considerable secondary, usually negative, effects on-61-7/5-6/94think quite correctly--that to the extent we affect our exchange ratefavorably and bring inflation and inflation expectations down as aconsequence, there are positive forces basically driving the system.That leads me to conclude that the fundamental exchange ratepolicy really ought to be that the best support of the dollar is tokeep domestic inflation down. What we have is anestablishment survey increase of about--was it 200,000, Mike?On the basis of the overall data that weget from the unemployment insurance system with a significant lag, weessentially are picking up what the BLS calls the \"bias adjustment\" inthe small business sector.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The other is that because the publicdebt/GDP ratio in both countries is exceptionally high, the rise ininterest rates was suggestive of the fact that the deficit might bemore of a problem. That is, the room for further declines ininventory/sales ratios has become very significantly limited and, as aconsequence of that, the process of going to zero change means a boomin inventory investment.Unquestionably an important concern here is whether we arelooking only at the end of \"just-in-time\" or looking at inventoryinvestment that is substantially unintended and that could back up asthe DRI overhang analysis suggests. It clearly is not through increases in prices.The question basically is how to reconcile this situation in which weget this huge increase in work hours and therefore in compensation ofemployees against a slowed GDP that suggests, other things equal, thatlittle suspicious of the GDP figures, although I grant that theunderlying work hour figures themselves may be exaggerated in thesecond quarter. Nonetheless, I think one must argue that there is a slowingdown in that particular area, and it is being offset, probably notfully, by expansions in the capital goods markets, which I suspect mayagain be underestimated in the GDP sense in constant dollar termsbecause the communications equipment prices just do not lookrealistic, as a number of people are beginning to conclude. But I do know that as we look at thesituation now, unlike where we were in the early stages of ourtightening moves, where remember I was terribly concerned--maybeoverly concerned but I doubt it--that if we did more than 25 basispoints we were risking the stability of the system.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Indeed, the decline has been enough to hold the levelof real inventories to a very slow growth path until very recently.As we discussed at previous meetings, all we have to do arithmeticallyis to take the \"just-in-time\" decline in inventory/sales ratios andflatten them out and inventory investment surges. Although it may well be that the data we will see-35-9/27/94tomorrow for durable goods orders will give us a different signal thanwe have been getting, to date there's very little in the anecdotalreports or in other data that suggests that orders have simmered downin any material way.The question on which I think we have to focus at this pointis whether there is an inventory recession threat at the end of thiscycle. They are moving up, or at least they had moved up at a veryabrupt rate until very early this year, which is another way of sayingthat unit consolidated costs have been rising much less than prices.Indeed, if one looks at the data, as inadequate as they are in thenational income accounts, we are getting a spread of well over apercentage point in the rate of change between unit costs on the onehand and prices on the other. Butunit labor costs apparently have been so well contained byproductivity gains at this stage that cost pressures have not flowedinto final goods prices.The question that we confront at this stage that has beenraised at this table, really for the first time in a broad sense--itstarted with Bob Forrestal and everyone just sort of picked it up--isthe possibility of a short-term blip in the final goods price data.If we look at business cycle patterns, we usually find that there is acycle in prices.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Let me just say, however,that inventories in my view are going to be the crucial area that willdetermine to a large extent how much momentum this economy has in it.It is not that inventories per se will engender the total grossnational product, but as you recall when inventory investment is high,gross domestic product is high, disposable income is high, consumptionexpenditures are high, and we get a very significant multiplier fromthat phenomenon.We can't look at inventories independently of final sales northe reverse because they are clearly interrelated. The trouble isthat the process of getting it right historically has led finally toour knocking the economy off its perch.I don't think that policymaking right now is very difficult.I think it is going to become exceptionally difficult when theexpansion starts to slow, unit costs no longer get distributed overrapidly rising output, and price pressures begin to emerge as GovernorKelley's teakettle starts to whistle. I think that creating a mild surprise would be ofsignificant value; creating a very strong surprise on the up sidewould be more risky because the stock market, in my judgment, is stilla little rich although off its price/earnings ratios of a while back.I would not want to argue that we couldn't break it down very easily.However, what bothers me about doing only 50 basis points is that eventhough the markets are saying that that is what we probably are goingto do, I think we have to distinguish between what they areforecasting we are going to do based on our past behavior and whatthey think we ought to do.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Remember, agoodly part of inventories is supported by the capital goods andconstruction markets even though we don't keep the data that way.As best I can judge, profit margins are still on the firmside and even though profit forecasts are beginning to look moresymmetrical rather than just continuously underestimated, the evidenceon the profits side is still quite positive. I do think the issue that Jerry Jordan raised is aninteresting one, and even though it is very difficult to provestatistically, it may well be that the fact that inflation isrelatively low may--despite all the discussions we have had about theinadequacy of the evidence--be contributing to improved productivity.If that is the case, we will get some greater growth in potential. I would only caution that if we get an unexpected breakout onthe up side in inflationary expectations, the distributed lag ofmonetary policy will bunch up very quickly. I do think the argument that most of the impact isdelayed is clearly a correct view, but I think we have to be carefulabout the probability--even though it is low--of significantaberrations that could have important negative effects.All in all, if we decided that we needed to move the fundsrate up at this meeting, which I don't support I must say, I doubtvery much that that would have a negative effect on economic activity.I think the economy's momentum is still quite strong. I do worry,however, with or without the Orange County turmoil and the usual end-of-year problems, whether we would be taking undue risks inendeavoring to tighten in this environment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That is an option for which I believe therewas some strong support within this Committee a year or so ago, mainlyon the grounds that we thought the taping inhibited the deliberativeprocess, not that we were concerned about the subpoena issue, which isa somewhat different question. It is crucial that those crackscontinue to develop or we will have a serious problem ahead.I would view the economic outlook at this stage as largely abalancing of forces, with capital goods markets, inventories, and theso-called interest sensitive sectors--housing, motor vehicles, and soforth--being the crucial elements in the outlook. I do not think there is any question that inventoryaccumulation is going to slow, but I do not see any evidence tosuggest that the slowdown started in January because C&I loans, which-105-1/31-2/1/95have been a reasonably good estimator of book value changes, ifanything look stronger since the end of the year. So we may actually get a much lower GDP increase in one ofthe next several quarters than we currently expect, and certainly lessthan is projected in the Greenbook, but it may be more a statisticaldiscrepancy question than any real economic phenomenon.In the interest-sensitive areas, where housing starts are thebiggest item, single-family starts are probably being held up by smokeand mirrors. Solong as capital goods markets hold and are not undercut, we probablywill have reasonably solid growth; but because of the inventorysituation, as Governor Blinder pointed out, we have a really goodpotential to bring the rate of growth down to moderate levels whichfor want of a better term pushes the economy toward a soft landing.Having said all of that, an argument can be made to staywhere we are at this particular time.\n",

      " Does anybody haveany questions with respect to this matter?The reason for the proposal to increasestaff access to Class I is basically that Jerry Jordan and I thinksome others among you have raised questions about the current limitand have suggested moving it up from 4. Now, some members of Congress may not haveunderstood it, but I must tell you that I got no negative responses,and the types of questions they were asking suggested to me that atleast those who were asking questions had some idea of the nature ofthis whole operation. I think we are all uncomfortable to a greater or lesserextent about our own swap line facility, and in discussions with theTreasury regarding all of these issues we basically have been to alesser or greater extent somewhat in opposition to the initiatives ofthe Treasury. Theirview may be that while the transaction is technically feasible in theprivate market, the inconvenience involved in arranging relativelylarge sums there raises questions as to the efficiency of theoperation. Nonetheless, thereare reasons to suspect that weaker growth may in fact be emerging thisyear, not because of seasonality but largely because of the operationof the business cycle.Gary Stern has raised an interesting question with respect toinventories. Now, I worry about that, and I worry about thatbasically because we could be our own worst enemies in this regard.I think that this raises an interesting question of policy,not about our fundamental policy but rather the symmetry/asymmetryissue about which I have mixed views. Ifind the probability that this slowing will cumulate into asignificantly weak economy that would induce us to move rates down isvery low.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The reason I raise the question is to5/23/95gauge how much of a drop in new orders can occur in the near termwithout unfilled orders also turning down.It strikes me that the concept probablydoes not have useful meaning unless we stipulate that we are in anenvironment in which the budget is balanced, prices are stable, andthe exchange rate is stable. Butthe presumption of a stable economy, maximum sustainable growth at5/23/95stable prices, and stable exchange rates does raise a question as towhat real interest rate structure is consistent with that. Is there any way, Mike, in which you candefine neutrality apart from making certain rigid prespecifications?The crucial question that you raise isthat of using his equation to capture what we were deciding over thelast eight years, and I suggest to you that that may be a littlefallacious in the sense that it can be misspecified by the choice ofvariables.Any other questions? As a consequence, I suspect that the thirdquarter is going to be softer than is projected in the Greenbook.Were it not for the fact that inventory levels, no matter how we-30-5/23/95measure them, remain quite low, I would say the concern that a numberof you have expressed with respect to the potential for reducedinventory investment working its way through the income structure andinducing a weaker consumption pattern in a historically typical waywould be something that we ought to be concerned about. And because othersectors of the economy such as capital goods and exports, and I mightadd homebuilding, are showing signs of sustainability, we don't havethe conditions that would induce the underlying system to crack atthis particular stage.The reason I asked Mike Prell earlier about the size of thegap between orders and shipments is that I suspect that we are goingto see new orders coming down in capital goods markets.\n",

      " We gotthere because it was very embarrassing to have higher growth cones-42-7/5-6/95when the growth figures were falling through the floor, so we decidedto adjust and we ended up at 1 to 5 percent. The inventoryadjustment process was under way, but not as rapidly as I thought wasgoing to be needed to be easily successful in removing the adjustment7/5-6/95in inventories as a retarding element overhanging the expansion; andthere was an increasing danger that it could reach a critical mass.But the data of the last few weeks clearly are moving in the directionthat, while the downside risks are still there, we at least seem tohave reached the maximum risk potential and probably are now somewhaton the other side. It is turning out not to bethat big a problem, because when we surveyedoperation, to get an idea of whether or not we are looking atcompetitive shifts or whether we are looking at real changes, ourcontacts while sensing that orders were weak, displayednothing remotely close to some of the negative vibes we were gettingfrom Indeed, the fact that ingot productionand, as best we can judge, finished goods production are holding upraises questions about how weak these markets are, because history asI remember it for the steel business tells us that when the marketsreally start to evaporate, shipments fall very dramatically and beforethat the ingot level goes down very sharply. That is, the markets didn't believe usand responded pretty much against it.I have concluded that, since the risks are beginning to easeslightly, there is no urgency here; but I do think we should movebecause I find it increasingly difficult to argue in favor of stayingwhere we are right now unless one can argue that inflationarypressures are still building.\n",

I think the difficulty isnot in productivity; I think it is at the Department of Commerce.Tom, there is no question that you areright on the longer-term rate spectrum, but if hypothetically we justsqueezed reserves out of the system, two things would happen: Thenominal rate would go up and the inflation rate would go down, and thereal rate would have to go up. I think that probablyreflects the fact that the economy is coming back and growing at afaster pace, but real pressure on the up side seems a good distanceaway, judging from all of the numbers we have at this particularstage. And the ambiguity with respectto the question of how appropriated but unspent funds are employed invarious authorization bills, when there is indeed no authorization forthe period after September 30, leads me to conclude that the rate ofreduction in discretionary spending will be modest in the short term.We will get very significant cutbacks in certain budgets, but overall,if entitlement spending continues as indeed it does in this particularcontext, the contraction in spending will be modest in the earlystages. It would be severe if a debt limit is allowed to go intoeffect.If in this process we end up with a very sharp reduction infederal spending, the fiscal drag issue will arise, especially if itis presumed that the decline in expenditures will be temporary.\n",

      " But if theywere to run into trouble, we could be dealing with very large numbers.Implicit in your question is that whenwe conduct our operations, a certain number of securities are offeredin the market and we choose to buy or not to buy. Indeed,there was one meeting which I found somewhat distressing back in Julywhere the general tone of our discussion was that all the risks wereon the down side even though virtually everyone was projectingmoderate growth. Thatwas a time when, as I recall, we were getting very severe contractionsin steel markets, industrial prices were weakening, inventories werebacking up in a number of areas of the economy, and it was only as weworked our way through the probabilities that we concluded that wewere moving beyond the point of the maximum risk of a recession.Under those conditions, I think we would expect to get a \"pop\" in theeconomy when the downside pressures begin to ease. The economy is not deteriorating, but itclearly has lost a good deal of the momentum that it had during thesummer. It is, however, difficult to make very much of that becauseas best I can see the evidence does suggest that the economy is stillundergoing some inventory correction. AndI am not certain that it matters all that much because the economydoes not appear to be threatened at this stage, and the urgency ofmoving quickly one way or the other is not there. We don't know that for sure,but the evidence of restrained unit costs and the existing high profitVice Chairman says, the fact that the expansion is \"long in the tooth\"and what we ordinarily would expect of an aging expansion.\n",

I don'tfeel that confident about it, but clearly this article, whichincidentally was written in 1989, has turned out to be extraordinarilyprescient as to what has occurred.Getting down to the mundane question of where that leaves usfor policy today, as a number of you have maintained, fallinginflation expectations have increased the real funds rate since July.Indeed, there is a question as to whether in fact the rate is highernow in real terms than it was when the nominal rate was at 6 percent.It is a close call as to whether it is higher, but it is not somethingthat one readily rules out. So, I am not concerned about moving lower in thecontext of worrying about reigniting product inflationary forces. Fortunately, I think we may be close to atleast some temporary peak in stock prices if for no other reason thanthat markets do not go straight up indefinitely, and the Dow JonesIndustrial average has been going literally straight up.I have no problem with moving down now knowing that, if theeconomy picks up, we have a quite significant amount of time to moveback up again and to tighten to whatever extent we think might berequired. For example if we were to do it, I wouldrecommend that the operative paragraph of our press statement saysomething like: \"Inflation has been somewhat more favorable thananticipated since the last easing of monetary policy in July, and thisresult along with an associated moderation in inflation expectationswarrants a modest easing in monetary conditions.\n",

      " What is really quite extraordinaryabout this period is that despite what we continue to envisage as anincreasingly service-related economy and one where business firms areincreasingly getting control over their inventories, inventoryinvestment has been the most volatile element and the greatestdeterminant of economic change in the last two or three years.In the early part of the 1990s, as firms finally weretechnologically capable of moving toward just-in-time inventorymanagement, inventory-sales ratios moved down precipitously. A big pickup inprofit margins was superimposed on that, which in turn fostered growth-22-3/26/96in the capital goods markets until we ran into the wall in early 1995when voluntary inventory accumulation temporarily turned involuntary.Final demand slowed appreciably, and you may recall that in June, oreconomy was on the edge of a recession. The economy worked its waythrough that, but inventory investment continued to fall throughout1995 as business firms endeavored to restore some degree of normality.In the early months of 1996, were it not for the weatherproblems that dominated a substantial part of our economy, estimatedat as much as one-third, plus the government shutdowns, we probablywould have begun to see some economic strength after the retardationin economic growth that the inventory adjustment engendered allthrough 1995. This obviouslyhas significant implications for the capital goods markets at somepoint and far more impact with respect to the question of what stockprices are going to do.What I find particularly bothersome is that history suggestsmore often than not that stock prices remain high for a protractedperiod of time when they should not; stock prices may just be waitingfor us to move rates up before they go down.\n",

      " The exchange rate would haveto fall fairly substantially to offset the gains in that sort of play.So, I am quite surprised there is not more of that type ofpositioning.Let me ask another question of you andperhaps Ted Truman. We mustseriously question our assumptions about how the sacrifice ratios andother factors are interrelated and not merely presume that we caninfer those interrelationships from the types of models that we use.I suspect that those models can lead to misunderstandings that weought not to entertain for very long. In my judgment, it probably iswise to recognize those risks and raise a serious question as towhether a policy action would provide some appropriate insurance inthis context.In my view real rates are still higher than I feelcomfortable with. And the more we look at what isgoing on in Europe, the more nervous-making it appears.Finally, while I would not want to rest policy on this, it isby no means irrelevant that a significant weakening in U.S. economicactivity is going to make a very important national policy trendtoward budget deficit control more difficult to implement.Ordinarily, I would say that that is their problem and this is ours,but we should have a view that what is in the national interest is notirrelevant to the way we conduct our business.I come to the bottom line that while I am not of the schoolthat is getting terribly concerned that the economy is about to dipinto who knows what, there is an increasing element of downside risksthat I think we have to consider.\n",

In a certain sense, it is also a good deal more subdued thanone would anticipate on the basis of historic cyclical patterns overmuch of the post World War II period and far more clearly before then.The crucial issue at this stage is the evaluation of the realside of the economy. What we are seeing is a significant increase in therate of capacity expansion of close to 4 percent at an annual rate asprevious major investment projects are brought on line and push upcapacity.-29-5/21/96The key to this outlook, as I see it, is not an evaluation ofthe physical side of the economy that appears in the Greenbook becauseI suspect that starting at midyear economic growth may well be on thelow side of recent experience. As I made the argumentback then, the state of technology is creating a degree or sense ofjob obsolescence and fear that apparently--I use the word \"apparently\"because we really don't know and won't know until we look at this inretrospect--has induced a tremendous shift away from increased wagesand toward more job security.

You may recall that in theolder regime a slowdown in M2 growth was an indicator of increasingpolicy restraint, but as the breakdown of M2 became increasinglyevident we resisted taking action largely because the collateralinformation that was available failed to confirm the usual meaning ofa sharp rise in income velocity. With the income effects thatspill over from inventory investment, it is very easy to draw a-83-7/2-3/96sequence of events that can create much stronger GDP growth than wehave in the Greenbook.It is too soon to know whether the current surge in theexpansion will gradually vanish and fail to ignite inventory growth orwhether the wealth effect will support PCE, with a lag, on a highertrack than is shown currently in the Greenbook.\n",

Thoseare the types of problems that would induce a significant increase insafety stocks and bring on the kind of accelerated inventoryinvestment that creates the major problems we have seen in the past.What seems to be involved here is not an increase in safety stocks,but an inadvertent drawing down of inventories to levels that areexcessively lean at any existing safety stock level. Whether they are successful or not remains to be seen, asGovernor Phillips quite appropriately suggests, but I do not think theautomatic elimination of further containment of benefit costs isnecessarily an obvious forecast.Nonetheless, with the U.S. economy operating at high levelsand very little evidence of cumulative weakness in recent data, therisks are and remain unquestionably on the high side. The chain store numbersdo appear to be modestly better seasonally adjusted for August thanfor July, but it does not appear to me to be a big deal, and theimprovement does not fully reverse the weaknesses that were apparentin both June and July retail sales data.As far as policy is concerned, if the economy is in theprocess of growing at an unsustainable pace or moving in thatdirection, raising the federal funds rate only 25 basis points is notgoing to help much at this stage.\n",

      " We have no third-quarter data on fringe benefit costs,but as I indicated in the August meeting in support of the views ofthe Vice Chairman, I think that health cost increases are still on theway down and still basically holding down overall compensation costs.Wage pressures are unquestionably the result of the tightness in thelabor markets that we have all seen, and that tightness by everyindication has increased rather than decreased in recent months. For those who have beenbrought up believing that productivity rose quite substantially from1960 through 1973 and then took a swoon, these data show that when weuse income-based statistics to disaggregate the nonfarm businessproduct data, which show a decline from a 3 percent annual rate in the1960s to 1.1 percent now, virtually all of that decline inproductivity growth shows up in the nonfarm, noncorporate area.Productivity in that sector rose at a 5 percent annual rate from 1960through 1973 and has been negative on average since then. In other words,the tremendous contraction in productivity, which all of our datashow, is partially phoney.-27-9/24/96The result of all of this is that if we look at theunderlying cost structure and adjust for the bias in service prices,which is obviously the source of this problem, we get an increase inreal gross product for the noncorporate sector, an increase inproductivity, and the numbers all make sense, assuming that theoverall price index comes out lower than implied by the publisheddata. While the probabilityis still better than 50/50 that we will not get through this periodwithout the very strong pressure on wages overcoming the productivityadvances and engendering a much higher rate of expansion in total unitcosts, I think the probabilities are falling.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My suspicion is that ourmeasures of labor costs may be biased downward in the third quarter.This is my impression for reasons other than those that have beenraised around the table.First, I don't think we have enough data to verify thishypothesis on a national level, but it clearly shows up at a microlevel in the sense that, when we have a very tight labor market, someof the wage increases take the form of promotions. So, while it may betrue that the wages of commission sales workers have been slippingrelative to the average, which is the reason why the numbers for non-sales workers have gone up somewhat more, that may be partially offsetby the higher wages of the increasing proportion of workers who havetheir salaries tied more closely to profitability.What I see as the bottom line of all this is that the wagestructure is extraordinarily dynamic and not easy to read. They may be revised down when we have more complete datafor the quarter, but they clearly will not be down by very much, andthey surely will not be down by anywhere near what is implied byholding the statistical discrepancy of the GDP accounts constant.The importance of all of this is that if we are still seeingevidence that the broader indexes of price inflation are easing, the-30-11/13/96rate of inflation is falling or at worst stabilizing, and profitsuggests that whatever is happening is not happening very fast. The growth in thestock of capital moderated in the third quarter, as best we can judge,putting downward pressure on GDP and on final demand.I think the regular inventory data are interesting,especially in the context of their being historically low by anymeasure.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " So, you can't argue that the minutes arewrong when they record what was said; you can only argue that they arewrong when the Secretariat inappropriately summarized what individualmembers said.I presume, as President Moskow says,that this is a solvable problem and not something that we have to12/17/96discuss here at length. The reason is that the best short-term forecasting system that I have seen on housing starts is one thattries to track the pace of net permits through to the starts figures.the level of net permits, meaning permits adjusted to the level ofstarts less cancellations, is significantly below the current level ofstarts whereas they were above in October. The fixed-weight numbers are lower; thefixed-weight plus adjustment for the overtime number that we calculatebrings the increase down to about .4 percent from .8 percent.Nonetheless, even with all of these adjustments, we are still gettinga mild degree of acceleration, which has not ceased. This is another way of sayingthat, if any competitor tries to move prices up in that environment,the profit margins of other competitors are such as to enable them tocompete at a lower price and still be above their hurdle rate ofreturn on equity. Therefore, while I think we can stay at \"B\" for awhile as we assess whether diminished demand pressures in the economywill reduce pressures in the labor markets before this transitionalprocess is over, I believe we confront a far greater likelihood thatthe next move will be up rather than down.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We wouldhave great difficulty adhering to them, and I think they would make our policy of moving towarda stable price level more difficult because we would have more political problems to deal withalong the way. [Laughter]In fact, as I am going to note explicitly in remarks that Iwill make later, I find that complacency very nervous-making and in particular its reflection inthe sharp narrowing of junk bond yield spreads against Treasuries, the level of equity premiumsin the stock market, and various relationships that one can infer from the financial structure.That's because, unlike anecdotal information, which is often difficult to replicate over time, wehave these series going back into the 1920s, and we have seen these patterns move up and downand up and down. I'm not terribly certain what it is, though everyone tells me itdoes.The types of things I would be looking for are indications that orders were flattening,capacity pressures clearly were easing, and we had at least sporadic reports around this table thatlabor market tightness, the crucial issue that is related to everything we have been talking about,was beginning to show signs of letting up. This essentially stipulates that the rise in wages will be less thanhistorically expected because of the markedly increased concern about job layoffs and thatsmaller-than-expected wage gains will convert to higher profit margins. That in turn will make itvery difficult for a firm to raise its prices because profits are more than adequate at lower prices,thereby prompting other competitors to undercut the higher prices and increase market share.So, I think the argument is that job insecurity affects wages and in turn prices, and that is theprocess keeping inflation down.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The gains surely seem to be showing up in a lot of areas,and it is very difficult to understand the profitability numbers we are looking at without somereference to significant improvements in productivity. Pricing power is gone, and the reason it is gone, as we havediscussed previously, is that competitors have sufficiently high rates of return to enable them3/25/97to undercut price increases and go for market share, should some firm try to raise its prices.This also implies that a degree of slack still exists in the system that all these business peoplecan see. Oneis that recent experience tends to reinforce our view that low inflation is very positive toeconomic growth, to employment, to stability, to all the good things we talk about withrespect to the economy. It strikes me that whatever we do, we need above all to makecertain that we keep inflation low, risk premiums low, and the cost of capital low. What we are trying to avoid is bubbles that break, volatility, and the like, but we are3/25/97not opposed to the implications of low inflation, which include relatively low risk premiumsand fairly strong economic activity.I conclude that what we clearly need at this stage is finally to move off the dime. \"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to tighten money marketconditions slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to rise about 1/4 percentage point toaround 5-1/2 percent.This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which hasprogressively increased the risk of inflationary imbalances developing that would eventuallyundermine the long expansion.In these circumstances, the slight firming of monetary conditions is viewed as aprudent step that affords greater assurance of continuing the current low inflationenvironment for the rest of this year and next and prolonging the economic expansion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Even more generally, going back over time we have tended to argue, Ithink correctly, that the objective of monetary policy is to create maximum sustainable economicgrowth, and we have argued, again I think quite correctly, that price stability is a necessary7/1-2/97condition to reach that goal. But price stability may indeed be a proxy for something else, whichI suspect is financial stability.If we look at the data with which we are working, part of our problem as we havediscussed before around this table relates to the fact that an increasing proportion of nominalGDP involves items whose prices, as we define and estimate them, have been undergoing verysignificant declines ranging up to 15, 20, or even 30 percent per year. The reason isthat if we define price stability in terms of whatever price measure we are using and if we runinto an increasing proportion of high-tech products with falling prices, we would be led by ourprice stability objective to inflate the economy because prices are falling. I would be uncomfortable about opening up discussions in a way that might not beinterpreted as an appropriately balanced view.I would be very concerned that it would be misread asmeaning that we have abandoned our objectives of a stable currency and stable inflationarypressures. Unless we can explain why wages are being held downbelow historically predicted levels for other reasons, I find technology-induced uncertainty themost credible explanation, although I grant you it is by no means a necessary explanation of thatphenomenon.The issue of profitability is, however, the crucial question because it involves acombination of subdued wages and a stronger rise in productivity than one would expect at thislate stage in the business cycle.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " So, my inclination at this stage, given my suspicion ofwhat would happen if we tried to resolve something that we have failed to do in the past for goodreasons--8/19/97After going through a lot of the possible variations withDon Kohn, it strikes me that we are not going to succeed in resolving this issue at this stage, and itprobably is not worth the effort of the Committee to try to force something that would make anumber of us feel uncomfortable. I suspect thatwe ought to be able to find out, hopefully within a year or two, whether this issue is ultimatelyresolved by the closing of the statistical discrepancy or by some extraordinary discovery of newdata that create a more reasonable set of real noncorporate gross product.Despite the absence of indications that inflation may be accelerating, signs are beginningto emerge that suggest we may finally be running out the string. The first is that we do not need any liquidation of inventories for the8/19/97economic expansion to slow; all we need is slowing in the rate of increase. The reason is that thelonger we are in a period where the economy remains exceptionally tight and price inflationcontinues to go down, the more difficult it will be for us to make a credible case for a policytightening move, indeed around this table let alone how we explain it to everybody else.We have not been able to address that issue because Idon't think we know how to handle a problem where we have one instrument and conflicting goals.What do we do?\n",

      " Have you spoken to anybody at the Bank of Italy to get a sense ofwhether in fact they were focusing more on German acquiescence in Italy's EMU entrance orwhether they were in a sense somewhat disturbed by the fact that the Germans seemed to bepushing their rates up?Mike, the data of the last couple of months clearly havebeen far stronger, especially in the manufacturing area, yet commodity prices have eased. If you were to take the type ofmacro environment we are looking at and you were trying to make up for a shortfall from yourearlier expectations, the numbers in such a forecast would, I suspect, be far stronger than the onesthat you have. But there also is very little doubt that the plant managers who propose thesenew investments anticipate very significant improvements in the efficiency of their operations, andthat ultimately leads to increased productivity. There is no doubt that we are seeing a fairly marked decline in leadpatterns and an increase in the ability of companies to meet unanticipated demand rather quicklythrough new facilities, whereas they could not do that before in any readily observable sense. As a consequence,9/30/97leaving aside the question of the unemployment rate, the NAIRU or whatever, we have afundamental disequilibrium in the labor market best characterized by the fact that employment isrising by 2 million each year and the population of people of working age who wish to work,including immigration, is going up 1 million annually. We are not arguing that the probability of rising inflation has increased, butthe possibility that we may be wrong is rising.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " You may recall that earlier this year when we were looking at the quiteremarkable and persistent rise of profit margins, we also were looking, given that prices were notincreasing very much, at very slow rates of increase in total unit costs, about two-thirds of whichare unit labor costs. This can belooked at in two ways: one, as an indication of very significant increases in prospective earningsstarting in 1993 when the acceleration in investment spending began; and two, as evidence--afterthe continued strong growth and indeed further acceleration of such investments in recentmonths--that after a number of years we may finally be getting sufficiently higher profit ratesfrom new facilities to suggest that the previously prospective increases in earnings have indeedbegun to materialize. The statistics we are seeing now seem to square readily with what we observe isgoing on in most companies.Of course, this is important because we can have an increase in compensation perhour, which indeed I suspect the numbers are showing, without unit labor costs moving up to apoint where they are pressing on profit margins or affecting the price level. Not only was unemployment falling, but the number of people not in the labor force whowanted jobs was declining quite appreciably. At the moment, I do not think we can tell.I'm not sure, even without the Asian financial turbulence, that I would have argued fora rate increase at this meeting largely because the developments that are emerging are of such aninteresting, if not important, magnitude that it will take one or two more months of CPI and otherprice measures to see what is going on.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I believe that lesson is understood by the IMF at this stage.12/16/97 62The issue really is not about raising interest rates for the purpose of affecting the exchange rate.It is essentially a balancing of market forces and an effort to keep the money supply fromgrowing too fast and potentially engendering undermining inflationary pressures.So, I do question the IMF and their tendency to use language relating to this SoutheastAsian set of actions that sounds very similar to that used to describe actions taken to counter theinflationary, government-debt type of problems in Latin America to which that language wasapplicable. If not, let me warn ofour talking about the \"worst\" case or \"worst\" around-the-world scenario because everyone herecan contemplate a case, which is far more negative than the so-called \"worst\" case.Oh, \"worse\" case. We do not have such data for the fourth quarter as yet, but the presumption thatunit cost increases are low and productivity is accelerating seems rather difficult to supportconsidering the size of the increase in the hours input, adjusted or otherwise for hours ofself-employed workers, in the available data for the fourth quarter. It will be difficult to get asignificant increase in productivity in the fourth quarter with the data we already have seen forsoftening is implicit in the Greenbook because there appears to be a very substantial aberration inthe 400,000 plus increase in the payroll employment number for November. As I have argued many times in the past and despite the latest set of12/16/97 69employment data, employment cannot increase indefinitely at the rate it has been increasing.Leaving the Phillips curve aside, leaving NAIRUs aside, leaving everything aside, I do not knowhow one can put negative people in an equation and then run it out.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Questions?The reason I raise the question is actually thereverse; it relates to anecdotal indications that when nominal wages are beginning toaccelerate, then business escalates its efforts to reduce costs and improve productivity.So, if that model were functioning in a meaningful sense, then a significant rise innominal wages could very well merely reflect the fact that productivity was rising and2/3-4/98therefore unit labor costs were not. We are trying toextract and stabilize that component of long-term rates because if we can do that, I thinkwe can demonstrate that it will create the lowest level of instability in the economicsystem and the position in which money plays its maximum role for economic growth.So, it may be that the problem down the road will not be that of following money; it maybe our great difficulty in determining how to measure it. Tocarry Governor Rivlin's view further, the difficulty I think we are running up against andindeed the problems we have been having for the last number of years are likely aconsequence of the major changes in technology that are fundamentally undercutting ournotion of the supply of money, not in a real sense but in the way we measure it. But at the first sign that there is any easing in the ever increasingpressure in labor markets, I think we probably will get a cascading effect, and we may getthe same slip-off-the-ledge effect in employment, though only with a lag behind theoff-the-shelf fall in goods production that we presumably are looking for sometime thisquarter.The importance of that obviously is crucial to how we come out on policy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I think the Dow is up about 1,000 points so far this year.Clearly, the situation is difficult to get into context because if we take the level of, say,the S&P 500 and decompose it into the riskless rate of interest, the projected rate of growth in3/31/98earnings, and, as a residual calculation, the equity premium, we end up with an equity premiumthat is at the lower end of the historical range of experience even if we accept the Street'sestimates of quite extraordinary growth in earnings. Nonetheless, there is no doubtthat the earnings growth numbers are slowing down.3/31/98That means that for the first time in evaluating the unit cost structure of nonfinancialcorporations, we are not looking at the phenomenon that I have referred to many times at thesemeetings of a very low inflation rate and stable or rising operating profit margins, the directimplication of which is that growth of unit costs is negligible. Productivity gains in these data appearto be sufficiently strong to keep increases in unit labor costs down to an annual rate of about 1-1/2percent for nonfinancial corporations.Basically, we are observing a very substantial wealth effect but one that has not yetspilled over to a significant extent into the product area, creating shortages of goods and services.As you know, there are none. In my judgment, echoing a good deal of what has been said around this table, unlesseither profit margins decline or some other developments break the back of this stock marketsurge in the very short run and take much of the strength out of the forces that dominate thisexpansion, we will have more inflation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nonetheless,it is enough to be a serious issue.TheIndonesian markets, as you know, are exceptionally weak and effectively shut down.A very significant but not widely discussed problem is the Korean labor situation.Korea has a big economy. The rise in stock prices has had a varietyof positive results, including the stimulation of increased effective demand that in turn has led tolarger federal government revenues that first lowered the budget deficit and more recently produceda surplus. I suspect, however, that in periods like thepresent when there are extreme shortages of certain skills in the workforce, a lot of the increases inlabor compensation are not showing up in higher wages for a given job but rather in promotionsand the like because that is the way business firms can avoid certain internal problems. But union contracts are becoming a smaller and smaller part of thesecurity concerns are still damping wage increases.If we were dealing with an economy in which the productivity data were not showingsignificant signs of acceleration or if we knew with some degree of conviction that the productivitygains were temporary, that the international financial system was not in as fragile a state as it is,including the Asian problem and its effects on Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and similar countries, then Ithink we probably would have moved the funds rate higher a meeting or two ago. That rise essentially picks up increases in unit labor costs of a little over 1 percent, unitnonlabor costs that are declining markedly, and a modest decline in profit.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " If that happens,then the growth in spending on capital goods also slows and that creates some negative internalmultipliers that conform total spending to the Greenbook forecast of much slower expansion indemand. In other words, the experience we have justgone through has really demonstrated statistically or at least has added a few important datapoints that corroborate the crucial importance of low inflation on maximum sustainable growth.If we start to get into a mode of worrying about not getting down too close to zero inflation, wethat. Interpreting what the money supply is doing in thecontext of a range that we stipulate as a price stability range has a certain meaning that in onesense may even be superior to our targeting the expected growth numbers and making ajudgment about whether our forecast is good or bad. We have fallen into a patternof setting the latter sort of ranges for the monetary aggregates, which frankly is not a bad idea.In my view, we should consider very seriously the possible advantages of any move away fromthose ranges because once we do so, we are going to open up a whole set of new issues that wewill have to address. I'm not sure we have as yet arrived at a point where we as a group feelreasonably confident about the stability or predictability of the monetary aggregates, at least asfar as I can judge from our discussions.I meant to ask a question before I got into my impression of our use of these targets.Your data show, as we have seen before, that the recent acceleration in M2 growth may merelyreflect a reversion of velocity to normal. If themost immediate evidence of some slowing in the expansion reflects nothing more than atemporary slowdown--a possibility that a number of you have raised and I think quite rightly--then I think we face a very serious potential problem of inflationary pressures emerging out ofthe labor market.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I have no doubt that as we move toward an unknown Y2K phenomenon,just-in-time inventories will get a little disrupted and concerns are going to arise that will create8/18/98some inclination to put a few extra goods on the shelves, so to speak. I am inthe group that sees no evidence yet that economic and financial conditions are stabilizing in Asia.Indeed, many of you have noted that conditions there continue to deteriorate.One of the problems that concern me about stabilization in Asia and perhaps other areasof the world is that the flexibility required for adjustments is inhibited to a very substantial extentby worker unrest. In fact,Japan remains the most difficult area and the greatest concern. But it is hard to argue that Europe is exhibiting the considerable economic strength that isstill obvious in the United States.One of the problems I have currently with our statistical system is that I am havinggreat difficulty figuring out what is going on in certain very crucial areas. Thebest way to describe them to you is by citing the fact that over the past year payroll employmenthas gone up by 3 million while household employment adjusted to payroll survey concepts--thatis, by taking account of agricultural workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, unpaidabsences, multiple job holders, and a few other minor categories--has gone up only 1 million.Hence, the statistical discrepancy has widened by almost 2 million. Over the past year, the adjusted household data have now also risen 1percent and the unadjusted household data have gone up somewhat more than 1 percent but8/18/98The serious question that we have at this stage is how significant the tightening in thelabor market has been over the last six months and the last year.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That is, the nature of our deliberations and the way we conduct monetarypolicy are quite different when the economy is under extreme stress, when the unemploymentrate is rising, when there is a cacophony of outside comments about the need to lower interestrates-- the sort of commentary we seldom get when the economy is strong. The evident failure of that to occur raised the question of whether bailouts areback on the shelf, and the associated market disruption reflected an abrupt reassessment of risks,which is captured in the very rapid changes that you mentioned. We see in the balance sheet data that are now emerging and that Governor Ferguson wasreferencing a fairly pronounced weakening of cash flows in the business sector coupled with anever-increasing difficulty of raising capital externally.If we have a contraction in both internal and external sources of funds, the questionthen arises as to how the momentum will be maintained in the capital goods markets, a sector ofthe economy that has been an important factor in the significant expansion of economic activityin recent years. Did we actually evaluate the loan portfolio that representedMorgan's claims against LTCM/P to see whether, in fact, Morgan abided by the principles thatyou just outlined?Where we are most vulnerable is with regard to theadequacy of our examinations.We rarely come up against a situation where we say this is awful, the institution is falling9/29/98apart, and we did not spot the deterioration. What have youconcluded, if anything, on that question?What technically happens in that kind of model is thatif we are resting on the last five years of experience during which the structure of the markets isessentially stable, that is, there were no severe contractions or even expansions, the covariancesthat we are going to pick up out of that five years are correct covariances for that population andthat environment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Theconsequence is that unit labor costs have been rising at a rate of less than 1-1/2 percent in recentquarters and total unit costs, which include declining unit nonlabor costs, have been increasing ata shade above 1 percent. With corporate prices generally stable, this implies a decline in profitthe past year.The importance of these data, as best I can judge, is that they suggest underlyinginflationary forces are continuing to recede despite the tightness in labor markets. Themeasure that I have found most useful recently in measuring the degree of labor markettightness, the sum of those who are unemployed and those who are not in the labor force butwould like a job, fell quite rapidly from 1995 through 1997 but stabilized at the beginning of thisyear and since then has moved hardly at all. In addition, the diffusion indexes in the payroll11/17/98employment series are clearly falling very sharply, suggesting that the recent slowdown has beenwidespread across industries.In any event, it is the case that the price pressures and the wage pressures are notbehaving the way they have in the past under comparable circumstances. It is this overall downward pressure, which I think is coming to a great extent frominternational forces, that clearly has undercut to a substantial extent the pricing power ofmanufacturing industries. The underlying diminished growth, which I think is fundamentallybeing caused by the squeeze on margins, has not yet shown up in the consumer areas, as best Ican judge.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Even the labor market data, which appeared to be weakor at least potentially weak at the time of our November meeting, now seem to have stabilized.While the gap between the household employment figures and the payroll numbers, which hascreated a crucial issue in labor market evaluations, has not yet closed, it has narrowed as aconsequence of a very large increase in estimated household employment in the latest survey.You also may recall that the statistical series that includes the number of unemployed plus thosenot in the labor force who would like to have a job seemed to have flattened during most of1998, but it tilted down again in the most recent data. To a verysubstantial extent in my view, the risks probably reflect the extraordinary behavior of the equityis a very big factor in the continued growth of personal consumption expenditures and hence infinal demand, seems to be attributable almost entirely in the last two or three years to capitalgains increases not only in the equity markets but, as I will explain shortly, in housing as well.If we disaggregate the household sector, we end up with a decline of a couplepercentage points in the saving rate as a result of the wealth effect and another percentage pointor so as a consequence of higher capital gains taxes. Such an announcement would haveavoided some confusion over the intermeeting period as market participants attempted tointerpret our remarks, and an unauthorized disclosure of the tilt occurred.An immediate announcement after the August meeting would have conveyed theCommittee's perception of a change in the risks from rising inflation to a more balanced outlook.In the event, as you recall, with your agreement I revealed the shift in a speech at Berkeleyfollowing our Jackson Hole discussion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Many of you have noted that the sequence of crises and decided weaknesses abroad clearly have had no broadly negative impact on the rate of growth in the United States, at least not yet. 2/2-3/99 104 I have not heard it argued specifically, but our 75 basis point action last fall was directed at countering a freezing-up of financial markets, which constituted a demonstrable threat to the stability of our economy, and arguably we have largely succeeded. There has been a legitimate concern about stock prices that, as an inadvertent side effect of our easing actions, have returned to record levels--a development that clearly has augmented effective demand. I find the resumption in the fourth quarter of the steep decline in the number of those seeking work to be the most compelling evidence of an unsustainable, and perhaps an unstable, economic expansion. You may recall that through the first three quarters of last year we had a sharp 2/2-3/99 105 divergence between the still strong growth of payroll employment and the apparently stagnant growth indicated by the household data. Moreover, despite our tightened labor markets, when we disaggregate the data, there is only very weak evidence of significantly greater compensation gains in areas where the unemployment rate is demonstrably below the national average. So an increase in uncertainty and the fear of job loss amongst workers cannot account for this extraordinary combination of low unemployment and no acceleration in hourly compensation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For quite a while our Greenbook and indeed all models have been projecting slower economic growth and higher inflation than actually have materialized. It is clear arithmetically, and indeed it is in the nature of any structural model with fixed coefficients, that if we continuously underestimate one fundamental variable that is rising faster than its underlying coefficient would suggest, then once we stabilize its rate of growth, we engender the type of forecast that we have in the 3/30/99 54 Greenbook, namely, a forecast that implies a slowdown in economic activity or economic growth and an acceleration in inflation. It slowed a little during the crisis in the summer of 1998 and previously in the crisis in 1997, but it did not go down; it just flattened out and then it took off again. Everyone has been concerned about weakness in manufacturing, but I suspect that manufacturing activity may have turned up. Everybody has seen an oil price increase, and the proportion of people who report that they have seen price increases goes up every time there is an increase in oil prices. Why are wage increases slowing down in this exceptionally tight labor the extent to which wages have decelerated in this period when the labor markets are so tight. Nonetheless, the combination of a slightly slower rate of increase in compensation per hour and accelerated productivity has lowered the growth in unit labor costs for the nonfinancial corporate area to 0.1 percent over the last four quarters, a significant 3/30/99 57 improvement.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Mike, in line with the notion you raised about the inability of maintaining the seasonally adjusted level of housing starts as we move into the period where the seasonals start to rise, I do recall that the unadjusted April starts figures were down. And as information technology gradually reduced the variance of error in the decision-making processes--in a sense knowledge became more and more crucial--the need to have all of these redundancies gradually dissipated. Because we are talking about a forecast with no change in labor’s share, an increase in expected earnings over five years has to show up either in an acceleration in the rate of 5/18/99 56 inflation, in the rate of productivity growth, or in the rate of hours growth. If we look strictly at the current data, what we end up with are increasing profit The latter come from the figures on aggregate wages and salaries in the NIPA data divided by hours or they come from the average hourly earnings in the payroll data; both show a very dramatic drop in the rate of gain in average hourly labor costs. I find it very difficult to uncover any useful evidence that suggests the increase in aggregate demand is slowing. What it does in my view is to position us to move in light of a lot of small indications in the CPI that other words, even adjusting for the measurement problems in the CPI with regard to the abnormal weight that it puts on apparel and on owner-occupied rents, there are indications in the latest numbers that the decline in inflation is coming to a halt.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That problem was easy to deal with when we were talking about stable trend productivity growth; when that didn’t vary very much it was easily interpretable into potential GDP and into specific money ranges. The reason is that, at least from my point of view, that issue comes to grips with a number of the crucial questions that we have to answer in order to get an effective policy. The forecasts this month of five-year cyclically adjusted growth of expected earnings per share for the S&P 500 are a full ½ percentage point higher than late last fall. Indeed, if we take what we reasonably know about manufacturing productivity, the number in the Greenbook for the second quarter for nonfarm productivity growth implies that either nonfinancial, nonmanufacturing corporate productivity growth is down sharply or, as I suspect, noncorporate productivity is negative--or some combination of both. Algebraically, the percentage increase in long-term expected earnings in the context of a stable long-term profit-to-wage relationship is equal to the sum of the expected inflation, the expected percentage rise in aggregate hours or population, depending on the way one may want to look at it, plus the expected percentage increase in productivity. They don’t make a distinction from one quarter to the next even though I would suspect that when we look back on this period, we are going to get a nonlinear, or more exactly an accelerating, longer-term growth path as the only way to fit the data.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My concern centers mainly on the increasing evidence of potential illiquidity problems, as people in the business community and financial community keep talking to one another about possible year-end developments. And the argument that the rate of inflation has stabilized I think is probably accurate, although it’s difficult to tell in certain respects for reasons I will get to in a minute. And if profit margins are rising, that basically says that some of the increase in prices or the lack of decline in prices has to be reflected in widening profit margins. Now, I don’t deny that if we proceed with the product-based GDP numbers and project a stable productivity growth 8/24/99 77 rate, that will produce an acceleration in the CPI growth rate. But that is begging the question, because unless and until we see some slowdown in productivity growth, then the argument that inflation is about to bite us is not credible. Inflation is clearly prone to acceleration should the increase in the growth of productivity slow or even stabilize. So there is a possibility that we could be confronted with a crisis that ironically could create another period of strength in the dollar as fears of the international political situation and other concerns emerge. With financial markets functioning more normally, and with persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming, and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary, economic expansion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It is algebraically necessary for such models to project a rise in inflation if they incorporate a constant rate of growth in productivity and we have a very low unemployment rate, which presumably creates some pressure for wages to increase more rapidly than the trend productivity rate. I would argue that we may be asking the wrong question, because it may well be that it’s the productivity acceleration that is engendering the growth on the demand side, directly and indirectly--directly obviously through income and indirectly through the increase in capital asset values. If we look at a breakdown of the supply side of the economy, what we end up with is that the total change in GDP is algebraically equal to structural productivity growth plus the growth in the labor force or the working age population or some similar measure. And leaving aside a number of minor issues such as average hours and statistical discrepancies--which are not unimportant--we find that the measure of the difference between the change in GDP and the sum of labor force growth plus structural productivity growth is effectively some measure of changing unemployment. Why don’t we do this: “In these circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for cost increases significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy.” 10/5/99 71 For everybody’s benefit, I am not of the opinion that writing a press release by committee is the most productive way of doing it, but this is a crucial one.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I want you to understand that this is a record low number of questions! For example, those around this table are, as a group, much more concerned about upside inflationary pressures; and I must say that I’m more comfortable being here than elsewhere. First, on the side of those who are less inclined to move, there is growing evidence that interest-sensitive areas of the economy are beginning to slow, at least at the margin. And it’s quite easy to demonstrate that it is not in their long-term interest to allow the value of those reserves to decline, which is what they would do if there is a sharp increase in the price of oil in the short run owing to the loss of market share. And indeed there is a serious potential problem here: Even though the importance of oil in the U.S. economy has gone down quite significantly as the importance of energy more generally has gone down as a share of the GDP, oil can still have a potentially quite destabilizing effect, especially on consumer confidence. In conclusion, I think we have a lot of uncertainties at this stage and the bottom line is that as long as we have a continuing decline in the total number of people who are unemployed, including those not currently seeking a job, that is telling us that the growth of demand exceeds the growth of supply. So I think the only question is whether we put more burden on them to be certain and less on ourselves.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My own judgment, and what I plan to recommend to the Committee, is that we have an opportunity now to move the funds rate up 50 basis points, remain asymmetric, and effectively adjust our longer-term posture to a better position than the one we are in at the moment. I would submit that what is creating a 1-1/2 percent estimate for productivity growth is the combination of a peculiar statistical discrepancy and some very dubious data in areas of the economy other than nonfinancial corporations; the latter provide our most reliable underlying data. The general view of a persisting acceleration in productivity is being picked up in a lot of the company reports where shortages of important inputs reportedly are beginning to arise. That is, as we are all aware and as I have mentioned previously, when we go from two-at-a-time connections to large network connections, the benefits do not just go up arithmetically; they go up exponentially. I mentioned, I think late last year, that I was concerned about our tendency to get caught up in statistical acrophobia and feel the need to make our forecasts converge to the mean because that is basically what happens in our models. So, it is perfectly conceivable that the GDP growth numbers for the fourth and first quarters were just an exaggeration. Indeed, the evidence is now beginning to show that the alleged absence of any effect from what we have done to date, or more importantly what the markets have done to date, is a false notion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I was just curious as to whether there was concern about that because if we are underestimating that coefficient on both the upside and the downside, it could be more destabilizing than even the less-than-optimistic appraisal of the overall outlook that you just gave. Have you tried at all to capture potential stock price volatility as a factor that would delay the sense of persistence of the gains? Were it not for a significant rise in wealth-to-household income, we probably would find that the propensities to save would be relatively stable, that the unemployment rate would be very low but also stable, and that the current account deficit, while large, would not be increasing. All I’m saying at this point is that one could not argue that this economy is heating up were it not for the gradual decline in the pool of people who are willing to work and an increasing share of overall demand being met from the import side. If neither lower expectations of future cash nor a higher discount occurs, then stock prices presumably will continue to rise, maybe in excess of the rate of increase in household incomes. In one sense, the recent experience is far more significant than the labor productivity gains in earlier periods, which as you may recall were at fairly attractive rates of around 3 percent for quite a period of time. And I am concerned that we might misread contractions in the economy or rates of growth, and as a consequence misunderstand where the forces in the economy are leading us.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It strikes me that the other question is whether it is bad if prices are and rising real growth--that is, keep nominal the same--we will then get declining long-term prices. There is no question that if people were to read that as accommodating more inflation, then the argument for moving up, I think, is unambiguous. And since we have been so successful in defusing interest in the ranges, the question is:  What do we gain by stirring this   103issue up? That is fundamentally the reason why we have opted for price stability--on the grounds that the risk premiums rise on both sides of price stability and that price stability is at the lower bounds of any evidence of risk and uncertainty almost by definition. Yet it is hard to argue the case of, say, a highly technologically oriented economy with productivity rising very rapidly, nominal sales and profit margins reasonably stable, but prices, however defined, falling. The one thing we know is that the apparent marked increase in profit margins in the fourth quarter, in the context of a relatively modest set of increases in cost structures, makes it very difficult to get around the conclusion that productivity growth is significantly above what the numbers are giving us basically because they are being reduced by a widening negative statistical discrepancy. I am concerned that, if we are too aggressive in this process of tightening, we could crack the market and end up with a very severe problem of instability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " One of the messages of those simulations was that, although the growth of real output was weaker and the unemployment rate higher, inflation would be little changed to a bit above that in our baseline forecast. Rather, the balance of risks statement envisions weighing the risks to economic performance relative to both of the Committee’s long-term goals--price stability and sustainable economic growth, the latter being a translation into growth rates of the legislated objective of maximum employment. And the case for balanced risks would be     76  stronger if the Committee saw better odds than the staff that an unemployment rate close to recent levels is sustainable, implying a smaller probability of an updrift in inflation than in the staff forecast. And the issue may not be easing per se, but moving to unbalanced risks toward economic weakness, which also might be more readily accomplished if the Committee already were at balanced risks. The forces that in my view have been most prominent since the last meeting are the still high level of oil and energy prices and the evident weakening of profit the capital goods markets where a lot of the recent weakness in the economy is coming from. Nonetheless, to date the easing of demand pressures has not been sufficient to warrant a change in the Committee's judgment that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth, and of the information currently available, the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But what is more impressive is that because he was the Philadelphia Fed’s economist to the FOMC, his attendance at these meetings goes back to 1971. I think at one time or another your wise counsel has changed the mind of everyone around this table, and I don't recall any instance when it went in the wrong direction. What I don't want to see happen is for the Treasury to go down a very specific path and SOMA to go down a very specific     - 12 -  path and end up with a collision. We have no problem--or at least I have no problem-- getting that issue resolved today. It is crucial that we confront this problem and get it resolved before it gets resolved inadvertently by our failure to act. That is a much smaller issue as far as I am concerned than this other problem. Accordingly, I think we should be moving another 25 basis points today, retain the sentence in our press release expressing the view that the balance of risks remains tilted toward inflation, and continue on a tightening path until there are problems with that path. The only area that actually looks weak is financial sector productivity, and I suspect that reflects a statistical problem, not a real problem. And assuming everybody agrees that the balance of risks is on the up side, I suspect that we have a very wide distribution of what people think that probability is.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " [Laughter]        Turning to the middle panel, as you can see, the euro forward rates declined a bit after the ECB raised rates on August 31st but moved down principally on rose again a little but then declined throughout September as evidence seemed to accumulate that euro area growth was slowing and may have hit a near-term peak earlier in the summer. Both 10- and 30-year Treasury yields backed up, with 30-year yields trading above 10-year yields for the first time since January, and this has been eagerly cited by those who have been concerned about inflation risks. And the slowdown in Europe is from lower levels of growth, while the uptick in inflation could perhaps be of a greater magnitude from the combination of rising oil prices and the falling euro. But over the course of the summer and into September, among the three major currencies I think we clearly have a problem of a weak and volatile euro, particularly against the yen. The red line showing the euro/yen rate leads the way lower in the top panel, as the spot rate has traded down, and the way higher in implied volatility in the bottom panel. As a consequence, when OPEC was able in the spring of 1998 to bring its production level down by a fairly pronounced amount--they brought it down about 3 million barrels a day, which is a huge number--that effectively began to open up a significant gap between demand, which was rising gradually, and supply.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Indeed, in recent years the ranges have become even more questionable benchmarks for money growth at price stability because of the uncertainties about long-run productivity growth and about what exactly we mean by price stability. So, unless I hear objections, I propose that we take advantage of this opportunity to stop doing something that I sense all of us have become uncomfortable with over the years--establishing money ranges of questionable usefulness that no one takes very seriously, or at least recently has taken very seriously. I do think the basic view among Committee members is that inflation is fundamentally a destructive force in an economy and a society, that inflation destroys jobs, and all other things equal that a stable price level, however defined, contributes to maximum sustainable growth. But it is also perfectly conceivable that after the fact we are going to find that multifactor productivity did not go down, that labor productivity growth did not slow down, and that indeed the unemployment rate went up--not a great deal, but some. And accordingly, since the capital investment has been pretty clear-cut and therefore capital deepening has been very easy to forecast, we end up with a forecast of slowed productivity growth, a slowed rate of economic expansion, and accelerated inflation. I suspect we   109Given that uncertainty, and echoing some of Don Kohn’s remarks, I think we have a fairly substantial amount of monetary tightening still in the pipeline, at least if we believe what we say about the lags and if a goodly part of the softening that has occurred in the economy to date is only modestly related to our monetary policy tightening.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Or are we going to find that as the supply of Treasury issues declines, the value of them, at least to many of the central banks, will rise? It was a moot issue for a long period of time because, as the dollar deteriorated through most of the period when we had reserves, we were engendering capital gains and nobody cared. But I would gather that if the dollar continues to strengthen and if the losses we publish, which are true or real losses, rise substantially, Congress is going to start to react. The analytical problem that exists when we have this type of productivity-driven economy is that it is by no means clear whether the increased capital investment will create a larger expansion of demand than potential supply. The July-over-July number is up a little more, but most interestingly the rate of increase of core PCE inflation for the last three months is, as I recall, only slightly higher than 1/2 percent at an annual rate. OPEC production is lagging because it is very difficult for a country like Saudi Arabia, which has very significant fiscal problems, to increase its oil output knowing its aggregate revenues could very well fall as a consequence. As a consequence, while inflation has not worsened materially in the sense of a spillover of higher energy prices into core prices, that outcome is inevitable unless energy prices start to come down.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It is conceivable that at some later date that we might be able to do what you suggest, but to do it before enabling legislation would be ill advised. It's not an abnormal concern, but clearly it is edging up. Were final sales to slow, my suspicion is that that particular number would go up quite noticeably. In the past, people didn’t know precisely what their inventories were, and as a consequence they rose very rapidly at times and were unambiguously out of line and recessions happened--usually before people had the inventory numbers that told them inventories were too high. [Laughter]  The rate of economic expansion has very clearly and unambiguously moved down dramatically from its pace of earlier this year, which was unsustainable, to a point where the general view among the members is that if it stabilized at its current level it would be sustainable. I emphasize the words “if it stabilized,” obviously, because the syllogism isn't that we had a high degree of unsustainable growth at the beginning of the year, that growth has moved down to a more sustainable pace, and therefore everything is fine. If we have an economy whose growth rate is declining, our models will have interest rates and costs of capital falling at speeds sufficiently rapid to engender a rebalancing of the economy--often before it falls into recession.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But at the moment, if we take our structural productivity numbers even remotely seriously, it is very difficult to get around the fact that not only will we see growth in the surplus, but substantial growth. But an important risk to the forecast, and one that we 1/30-31/01 102explored in the “recession” alternative in Part 1 of the Greenbook, is that the abruptness of the production cuts and the recent torrent of layoff announcements--such as yesterday’s from Daimler Chrysler-- might lead to a severe break in consumer and business confidence. If we had enough recessions so that we had two separate systems of models we could argue that the coefficients in the recession models are different and that when we go from expansion to contraction the coefficients change and we get a sharp discontinuity. As I mentioned yesterday, when the economy is in an expansion phase, which is still going on but slowing down, increased uncertainty in and of itself raises risks and induces people to differentiate among the risks they are willing to take. And the clear weakening in production that we’re getting in certain areas of the economy in January, although production is not falling on its face, is probably an indication of the inventory liquidation that is now under way. But after experiencing this huge bubble of speculative activity and looking at price-earnings ratios, which are not by any means depressed, we can’t be sure that this expansion will just slow down, then pop up, and continue the way it was.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " After the Committee’s January meeting, both cash and forward rates were stable at first but began to decrease as the equity market fell under pressure, with announcements of earnings shortfalls in the corporate sector, and as speculation regarding an intermeeting move increased. Currently, with the three-month cash rate--the solid red line--already below 5 percent, the market is anticipating further easing beyond any actions that 75 basis point cut at this meeting has coincided with the spillover of weakness from the NASDAQ to the broader stock indices. I don’t know what the relationship is in the high-tech area between outlays for replacement and modernization and outlays for capacity expansion, but if we assume that replacement and modernization expenditures do not change as the growth in expenditures for new capacity falls from 50 percent to, say, 20 percent--a still very dramatic and strong increase--growth of capital investment obviously will decline by 30 percentage points. The uncertainties surrounding the negative wealth effect, along with the absence of any evidence that the rate of downward adjustments to expected profitability figures, as Mike Moskow mentioned, are not doing all that badly and the liquidation of inventories continues. For those who believe that the provision of central bank liquidity is bullish for stocks, history tells us that an overhang of uncertainty about when or whether the Fed will move to lower rates creates a downside or negative risk premium that may well have a larger sustaining effect than acting to remove the uncertainty.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rate, at 4.5 percent, already has moved up more than 1/2 percentage point, and unless the economy reaccelerates much more rapidly than we, or virtually anyone else anticipates, it is difficult to envision how the jobless rate will not move higher in coming months. That markets have built in considerable odds of a further 50 basis points of easing today and some chance of another 25 basis point decline in the funds rate by year-end may be more a comment on perceptions of your policy strategy than on what participants see as desirable to achieve satisfactory economic outcomes. Even if you suspect that ultimately you will need to ease by a full 50 points but are far from certain, the smaller action would enable you to accumulate more evidence about the strength of demand and the response to earlier easings. With sluggish growth likely to be reducing pressures in labor and product markets in the period just ahead, inflation should be damped and economic growth below the growth rate of potential could still be seen as the main risk to satisfactory economic performance. The unemployment rate is clearly on the way up, and with demand weak or on the soft side, it’s really a question of a tradeoff of rising or accelerating productivity and rising unemployment or the reverse. The crucial arguments in support of forecasts that economic activity will  accelerate and indeed pick up toward a 3 percent or more growth rate next year largely rest on the notion that profits will stabilize and that the stabilization will in turn stabilize capital investment and 5/15/01  80 allow the termination of inventory liquidation to trigger a recovery.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, I suspect that if we spent a good deal more time on the capital input data, we’d come up with a lot more problems than you’re raising, Jeff, or that Dan is raising as well. We know that home sales are doing reasonably well and consumer confidence, although down sharply, seems to be stabilizing at least temporarily. The overall climate does seem to be a little better after a period in recent weeks when absolutely everything was negative, but there is no doubt that the overall picture is still quite weak. I think the answer is “no.” But the problem of having had this big surge in capital investment raises the question of whether we can maintain, as Mike Kelley I think quite appropriately observed, a more stable regime with respect to the funds rate as indeed was the case in much of the period from early 1996 until the early fall of 1998. If we believe that monetary policy can stabilize the economy when confronted with the types of forces we are seeing, the implication is a highly volatile federal funds rate that moves against those forces on the upside and in the other direction on the downside. So there is a question of whether we have an internal problem in policymaking, namely that if we indeed stabilize the system for too long, risk premiums fall, speculation tends to emerge, and we face the type of problem that we ran into.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " What I believe has happened, as I think I indicated at the last meeting, is that the uncertainties with respect to the change in the outlook have fostered a significant rise in risk premiums in the capital goods expenditure has increased. But we have to project that capital spending will fall below sustainable levels, and indeed in a sense build up some backlog. Moreover, with the energy costs coming down but the contract costs of energy still somewhat higher than the spot prices, there is a delayed effect in the impact of high energy costs on profits. The more I look at the data, the more I am persuaded that the deflationary effect of lower equity prices is concentrated in the capital goods markets. And, as best I can judge, that is wholly a reflection of the fact that the propensity to consume out of realized capital gains on homes appears to be significantly higher than it is on both unrealized capital gains on homes and capital gains in general on equities. In sum, with foreign economies clearly weakening significantly, we are in a situation as best I can judge where the economy is being held up by household demand, which fortunately is running somewhat better than I think many of us would have anticipated. What we need is some real evidence that the capital goods markets are bottoming, that profit erosion has stabilized, that we are seeing signs of an upturn instead of still further negatives whenever we evaluate what individual companies are doing.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  First, let me say that despite the tensions you were under, you make it sound very simple. But if it’s wholly a matter of supply, can’t you normalize that judgment against corporate issues? We now go to the most important part of the meeting-­the most informative, illuminating, and provocative, right? We are talking about losses in the last week or so of more than a trillion dollars in the value of stock market holdings. That in turn suggests to me that the notion that somehow we are beyond any further deflation from the asset side is at least open to serious question. And without getting into more discussion on the issue, I would merely say that what we ought to do--as I think most of the people around this table already have suggested--is to ease  10/2/01 83 by 50 basis points and retain the statement indicating that the risks are tilted toward economic weakness. I do think our degree of uncertainty is higher, but that’s the nature of the game. 10/2/01 88 [Meeting recessed] As you can see in the draft press statement we’ve distributed, we’ve adopted the Hoenig principle on these types of press releases on the grounds that the more we try to say, the more complex the issue gets and the less clear our actual message. Does anybody have any strong objections to letting it go as it is?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The alternative forecast would be one that violates the rules of statistical inference or, I should say, the great historical research that Dave Stockton set into motion, which concluded that the United States has never had a recession that failed to end. The problem unfortunately is that the estimate for October sales is so bizarrely out of the ordinary that even if there is a good deal 11/6/01 79 of real change in the demand for motor vehicles, sales will still have to come down very sharply just to get back to something resembling normal. And what I conclude is that if doing 50 basis points today is wrong--if it turns out that the economy starts to stabilize tomorrow and a lot of things go well--being required to move our funds rate target back up would be the most delightful problem we could conceivably face. I do think that if we have an inadequate response today, there is a danger--because as I see it we are at a critical point in the way this economy is functioning--that we will be taking too high a risk. “Although the necessary reallocation of resources to enhance security is likely to detract from measured advances in productivity for a time, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.” Let me tell you what the problem is.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The reason we are seeing a smaller negative than the markets is that there is a lot more current 12/11/01 80 productivity growth--or more exactly growth in output per hour--in the manufacturing area than outside observers are assuming. That slower rate of decline is also reflected in the very rough weekly series that’s supposed to replicate the industrial production index; it shows that most of the decline in of October, but it couldn’t come back enough to prevent the average for November from being below the average for October. But when the rate of change is as great as it has been in recent months, and when the rate of layoffs is as high as it has been, we are getting a whole new set of consumers that are shocked by uncertainty. Analysts and stock purchasers may be looking beyond the current squeeze in profit expectations to a much better longer-term outlook and may perceive that the increased flexibility of the markets may itself enable lower equity premiums and the obverse higher price/earnings ratios to persist in the marketplace. If that’s the case, it is conceivable that the earnings outlook could stabilize, perhaps even improve, in which case capital investment can stabilize and consumption may still do well on the presumption that long-term mortgage rates do not keep going up and create additional problems. I would only argue that the risk of doing nothing is too high because I think that the play-out of deflationary forces, at least looking at profit expectations, is not anywhere near complete.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " During most of December, equity markets were stable or rising, as investors anticipated an economic rebound. Turning to foreign exchange markets, the dollar has been stronger against most major currencies—not only against the euro and the yen but also against other currencies such as the Canadian dollar, which fell to a record low a few days ago, although it has recovered somewhat. Some suggested that the prospect of better growth in the United States and later in Europe was a more important influence in these markets than the distress in Argentina. Earlier today, Dave Stockton raised the question of a potential internal inconsistency in the forecast, which stipulates that profit margins will remain flat at a very low level but also assumes that the stock market holds up, the wealth effect does what it does, and the demand for capital goods starts to come back. However, one should seriously question whether including the realized capital gains on company-issued stock options in employee compensation while excluding capital gains from company profits constitutes “single-entry bookkeeping.”  Indeed, if the capital gains on the exercise of options were to be included in company income, the profit share would be boosted by a sufficiently large amount to bring it back to 1991 levels at least. The usual expansion in profit margins coming off of the bottom of a business cycle typically is boosted by a turnaround from negative to positive output per hour.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That volatility had stayed at a high level in the months after September 11 but recently has declined to its lowest level since that date, though it remains at elevated levels compared with its historical average. The size of our total RP holdings rose quite suddenly in the aftermath of September 11, as we stopped our outright activity for a few maintenance periods while currency growth remained robust. But the rapid growth in currency has continued to surprise us over the past several months, and the rapid pace of SOMA expansion still has not allowed us to bring down our holdings of RPs, including long-term RPs, below the October levels. Does the fact that initial claims seem, at least temporarily, to have stagnated at a weekly level around 400,000 suggest that the type of rises in payroll employment and in hours that are required to bring the growth in output per hour down may not be happening? A characteristic of turning points is that, as the economy goes from negative growth to zero growth to positive growth, it is very difficult to estimate the slope of the upturn, and differing slopes imply huge differences in the performance of the economy. Indeed, as you may recall, it slowed down enough that the Carter Administration came in postulating the persistence of a recession and proposed a fiscal stimulus package because that’s what they had promised during the election campaign. The argument against that is that, even though the economy has evidently gone through a period of marked increases in flexibility and resiliency, we may be facing an outlook for inflation that is much more difficult to assess.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As shown in the bottom panel, the ten-year TIPS spread, which had widened in February and early March, stabilized as expectations of a strong recovery moderated and as commodity prices stabilized after rising earlier this year. The generalized decline in nominal Treasury yields has occurred despite the more bearish factor for Treasuries that the markets have had to contend with in recent months, namely the shifting fiscal picture. After complaints about a shrinking supply of Treasuries in the last several years, the market has absorbed this higher level of issuance so far without any evident strains. With the steps taken by the authorities to prop up equities in late March and the realization that the Japanese would muddle through the fiscal year-end without a major crisis, equities began to rise, the yen began to appreciate, and JGB yields began to decline. Yields on JGBs have declined despite their downgrade to double A minus by Standard & Poor’s and their possible downgrade by Moody’s in the next few weeks to the high single A level. There is a question as to whether or not the capital goods markets can lift final demand, which is already at a relatively high level but obviously is going to have difficulty increasing further. But there is no question that, if firms don’t invest to expand capacity, or at least for a combination of cost reductions and increased capacity, which most equipment outlays actually    achieve, then the result is a lower level of overall outlays.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " With the exception of Japan, this country has the lowest yields of the group, whereas in 1999 and most of 2000, ten­    year U.S. government yields were as high as, and in most cases higher than, those in many of the countries listed in this graphic. In the middle panel is a graph of the S&P 100 volatility index, also known as the VIX, which has risen sharply in recent weeks to a high of about 32 percent, coinciding with the recent weakness in equities. If we took the data literally, the argument for globalization being a critical issue in the loss of pricing power is put up against the issue that somehow we get better productivity out of goods production than we do out of services production. And if it is and if compensation of employees is not picking up all of the gains in productivity, as clearly it is not, then of necessity the productivity gains have to flow over into profit margins unless we see serious evidence of accelerated deflation or actual price declines in the corporate sector. The demand for housing is pressing up against land shortages and the like, and we are getting fairly dramatic increases in a lot of areas in the market value of homes and hence in the total housing equity, from which there has been a consistent degree of extractions. Previously, consumers were not able to extract cash easily out of the rising value of their homes, but they can now, and that source of funds has been a strong sustaining force for spending through the recession.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " On the demand side, investors who have taken losses in their portfolios in recent months have been reluctant to expand the amount of credit risk in their holdings. As the equity markets declined and fixed income markets turned volatile, the price of insurance expressed by implied volatilities rose. The top panel on page 3 graphs the implied volatility on the S&P 100 equity index, which had been rising steadily since late May but spiked higher in July and peaked at about 50 percent in late July and again in early August. In contrast, implied volatilities on currency options rose in late June but quickly began to trend lower again. More recently, the reassessment of growth prospects in Europe has resulted at least in a pause in the dollar’s trend to the downside against other currencies. We are now looking at equity premiums that have risen in the latest period above their 1994 averages, after having declined to virtually record lows. The trouble with that assessment, unfortunately, is that stock prices historically have always moved above and below fair value in the sense that they never seem to stop at fair value. Having said all of that, the general outlook still strikes me as being solid in an underlying sense, but without question there has been substantial deterioration and it’s not going to be easy to read the significance of the corporate governance problems.\n",

      " In short, investors who have concluded that the corporate market has high risks and low returns would not be out of bounds, at least based on the experience of the past four years or so. Since euro area, represented by the solid red line—has fallen more than 30 percent, including declines yesterday and today. One question that has been asked over the past year or two, as the levels of defaults grew, was which balance sheets were absorbing these losses since few indications seemed to be popping up with banks and securities houses. The yield on the ten-year bund to take one example—shown in the bottom panel—has fallen about 90 basis points since early economies, one might ask why yields, which are still nearly 65 basis points above comparable U.S. yields, did not drop even more. Since June, the monthly growth rate has fallen sharply into the low single digits and shows little sign of a turnaround. This suggests that the coefficients may in fact be significantly higher under certain conditions, or it may be that the coefficients are nonlinear and rise with the rise in the price of oil. One scenario is that we are going to get the impetus from developments that I would associate with potential pent-up demands—that is, considerable liquidity in the corporate sector, very tight inventories, capital investment that has been held down to a marked degree, productivity that is still improving, costs that are still improving, and profit margins that presumably are at least holding or maybe even rising.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Forward rates had a minor roller coaster ride, first declining immediately after your September meeting, rising in mid-October as equities bounced off their October 9 lows, and then heading downward again as the economic data were perceived as pointing to economic weakness. negative, but in late 1997 it abruptly turned positive and, though choppy, has on balance remained positive. Meanwhile, issuance—shown in the bottom panel—has been falling as in the United States, but the full credit picture in Europe is more difficult to gauge given the greater reliance on bank financing by European companies. The only question is whether underlying profitability is    improving, and the answer to that is apparently “yes.”  If we look at the NIPA accounts and adjust for the fact that stock options are expensed when they are exercised rather than when the actual opportunity cost is incurred, we get a weaker underlying profit figure than we ordinarily would expect, given our assessment of what productivity is doing and what everything else is doing. If that turns out to be the case, and I suspect that it will though I cannot say I know for sure, it means that cash flows will be improving and that stronger capital investment will eventually materialize provided the overhang of uncertainty, very specifically the uncertainty relating to geopolitical risks, dissipates. In sum, the benefits of retaining the current tilt toward weakness in my  judgment are very small, and the risks of misinterpretation are very high.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For this exercise, we arbitrarily defined distressed investment-grade bonds as those trading at a spread over Treasuries of 500 or more basis points, and we defined distressed high-yield bonds as those with a spread of 1,500 basis points or more. That percentage dropped sharply one month later in the days immediately after the Committee’s meeting, and it fell still more as of this past Friday as shown by the green bar on the bottom left. The S&P 100 volatility index, or VIX, fell from about 50 percent in early October to about 26 percent in late volatility index rose again into the low 30s as equity prices began to decline. Finally, twelve-month foreign exchange volatilities for the major currency pairs have remained low and short-dated volatilities were lower still. But the other factor at work is the notable shrinkage in the commercial paper market in the past year, as the most vulnerable issuers withdrew from the Turning to page 5, European markets have coped with weak data, lower forecasts of future growth, a weakening fiscal outlook in major countries, uncertainty about the Stability and Growth Pact rules, and—until last week—uncertainty about the willingness of the ECB to ease policy to counter slow growth. Mr. Shiokawa backed off in subsequent days, and the yen retraced its decline a bit, but on net it was modestly weaker against most major currencies over the past month.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " With interest rates where they are today, there is the risk that if the general collateral rate goes below 1 percent or if the Committee at some point should choose to lower interest rates to 1 percent or less, that would then effectively shut down the securities lending facility. I suspect that, if we could distinguish between risk neutrality and risk aversion, we probably would find that we are much closer to risk aversion. But with those sources drying up more recently, the expected returns on short-term investments have become much more important to the financing of the deficit. Turning to page 2, in the past two months the dollar has shown a steady decline against most major currencies, with the decline of the dollar against the euro most pronounced. Given the losses that investors in general have had in riskier assets in the last few years, that yearning to “stay home” is understandable even without the uncertainty generated by event risks. The negative interpretation that some are taking is that longer-term rates, although low in absolute terms, have remained unusually high despite the fall of short-term rates. So the impact on our economy may well differ from that related to the Gulf War—when the probabilities of success became very evident shortly after the air war began, with the result that risk premiums in financial markets came down sharply from their highs and the price of oil plummeted.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Since your last meeting, markets have been characterized by a high degree of risk aversion—driven, first, by uncertainty about the timing and extent of war in Iraq; second, by uncertainty about the underlying condition of the U.S. and other global economies as growth forecasts were being trimmed; and third, by data on the real economy that tended to disappoint market expectations. During most of the intermeeting period, investors favored government bonds; their yields declined to new lows in many cases, while equities fell sharply and the dollar depreciated. Part of the dollar’s decline was attributed to weaker economic data, which seem to have had a more pronounced effect on the U.S. currency than weak data had on either the euro-area or Japanese markets and currencies. One could argue that they are being more prudent and are protecting against risk a little better, but that is not showing up in the way investors are assessing their equities. I believe almost everybody would argue that the economy is weak, and indeed I suspect on the basis of the most recent numbers that economic activity has probably been There was some significant improvement in economic activity from Christmas through the first week in February, but the economy subsequently began to weaken measurably, evidently in conjunction but not necessarily in line with the significant rise in gasoline prices that started in early February. You can argue that the Iraqi and Venezuelan situations are having a negative effect, but you obviously can’t argue that all of the negative effect bearing on current economic activity is a result of concerns about oil.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Simultaneously, the degree of risk aversion decreased and spreads narrowed, volatilities declined or stayed at low levels, equities rallied in most markets, and a consistent theme among investors was the search for yield. As shown in the top panel, which depicts the S&P 100 volatility index, that measure of equity volatility is back to below the 25 percent level for the first time since corporate governance worries heightened after the WorldCom collapse. Indeed, the expansion of the communications network that was going on prior to the huge decline in capital investment as risk premiums rose in 2000 was by any measure that we know not completed, and the longer-term outlook for such investment still looks reasonably solid. I myself find it difficult to believe that such growth is in prospect because, if it is, that has to mean that by a few weeks from today growth of real GDP estimated on a monthly basis has to move up appreciably or else 4 percent growth cannot realistically be achieved in the third quarter. An economy in which prices are falling at, say, a 5 or 10 or 15 percent annual rate but where rising productivity is matching the decline such that the nominal rate of return on capital is stable or rising tells us that we do not have a destabilized economic system. The point here is that the term “sustainable growth” is a proxy for an expanding economy whose growth is internally sustainable, meaning it does not have in it the seeds of its own demise.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " What will happen to spreads as rates get down to very low levels, and what does that imply about elements of risk and stability in the financial system and in a sense the whole global financial infrastructure that is well beyond our immediate concerns? In addition, the outlook reported by some major companies surprised investors—not so much because sales and profits are expected to suddenly expand rapidly but more that, after several years of continuous downward revisions to their outlooks, there are signs of businesses stabilizing and some even showing modest improvements. Freddie had been enjoying a relative borrowing advantage over Fannie ever since the latter announced its unexpectedly high duration gap in August 2002, leading to a widespread view that Freddie was less risky because of more-aggressive hedging of interest rate risk. The reason that this is such an interesting and critical test is that we are not in the middle of either a vigorously expanding economy, in which it would be very difficult after the fact to isolate the effect of the tax cut, nor are we in a significantly weakened economy, in which it would be difficult to extract the momentum stemming from the infusion of Treasury cash. So what I want to put on the table at this stage, and I hope it’s acceptable, is to move the funds rate down 25 basis points, maintain the assessment that the risks to sustainable economic growth are balanced, but continue to imply that the risks of igniting inflation are very low.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Fixed-income markets in the intermeeting period were characterized by a high degree of volatility, as market participants readjusted their expectations for the future path of monetary policy in response to the Committee’s June 25 statement, comments from various Committee members emphasizing near-term growth prospects, the generally positive economic data, and a relatively strong corporate earnings season. Occasional rumors circulated again about some bad positions and some losses in the dealer community, and liquidity was reported to have decreased as demand for fixed payer swaps rose. The dollar has risen modestly against most currencies since June, consistent with the higher yields and the more upbeat view of the economic outlook. To a substantial extent, those profits are coming out of cost-cutting activities, and that inevitably means, as I’ve said in the past, that business firms are still taking advantage of potential productivity gains that were not exploited during the boom period of 1995 to 2000. Unless we can argue that the propensity to spend is significantly higher in the lower income groups than in the higher-income groups, which seems to be the conventional wisdom though it does not seem to be validated all that much by the data, then whether we are getting productivity gains or getting more employment only modestly affects the average propensity to consume. So it is important that we get the rate of GDP growth up adequately above that of productivity to get an upturn in employment. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nonetheless, despite what has really been a long run of broadly successful monetary policymaking, we find ourselves confronted with what to some observers is a seeming inability to communicate. Indeed, market participants obviously had discounted such a shift to a significant extent by driving the ten-year rate down to just modestly above a historically low 3 percent. One is that there was a general view in the marketplace that we would not reduce the funds rate below 75 basis points largely because of the difficulties that would create for the internal dynamics of the money belief was that not only would we start to engage in a further easing of policy but that we would do so at 75 basis points using a so-called nontraditional approach. The general conclusion of the staff, and I think of the FOMC members, was that this would create some difficulties but, if we needed to move the funds rate down further, it would be desirable to do so. If there is a serious question as to how the statement will come out, I think there’s more than enough time to communicate with Vincent and indicate that there are problems. I want to call to everybody’s attention the most egregious form of that problem, which is the ECB’s M3 problem. Well, as I’ve said to many of you, I remember well that people held that view even more strongly in the late 1960s; and it was only a very few years later that we realized it was wrong, when nobody could explain how it was possible that inflation was rising with a very large gap remaining.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Around that time, some market commentary briefly raised concerns about nascent inflationary pressures, but those concerns proved to be short-lived, and the two-year note yield fell sharply after the employment report. All had risen sharply since their June lows before edging down in recent days—again as questions about the sustainability of the recovery emerged. The bank sub-index has risen even more, as perceptions about the global recovery grew and the bailout of Resona Bank earlier this year removed what had been very negative sentiment toward the financial sector. Elevated and chronic fails have the potential to diminish liquidity in the market if market participants step back from trading because of uncertainties about settlement, concerns about credit exposures, or concerns about the capital that they may need to allocate for aged fails. Getting back to the reasons for the dramatic downward shift in currency growth, it was depressed in June and July because of exceptionally high foreign reflows on top of weak domestic demand. That development coupled with significant deregulation and major technological advances in the United States, as I’ve commented previously, has led to a marked increase in competition; that increase has been slow but persistent and more and more evident as the years have passed. The next step is clearly either to confront serious disinflation, which has been our concern through most of this year or, what I see as far more likely, to move away from that concern.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The ten-year note of May 2013, which is now once off the run, has continued to trade with a high degree of scarcity value in financing markets and with a high level of fails. The high-yield index narrowed to a low of 453 basis points, the lowest level in about 4 years, while the EMBI+ spread hit its lowest level in 5½ years. While a narrowing of spreads is expected during an economic rebound as the quality of credit improves, several strategists are voicing concerns about whether a liquidity-driven rally has pushed spreads to unsustainable levels—particularly in the emerging-market sector. Purchasing managers at manufacturing firms, who are probably best positioned to have a sense of whether their customers’ inventories are high or low, are reporting that they are extraordinarily low. If we actually allow this whole question of who says what and how the press will read it—whether it’s up, down, or sideways—to affect our judgment regarding the implementation of the optimum policy, we are making a very bad mistake. If we say, for example, that our goal is to get the unemployment rate down to 4.6 percent with a growth rate in GDP that would close the output gap by X percent or something like that, that’s all well and good. He’s trying to put in hard numbers or get something more conclusive than a vague notion of what is maximum sustainable growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Euro forward rates largely moved in sympathy with U.S. rates; but in Europe, too, the data improved, and European growth forecasts were revised higher. There have also been false alarms such as in early 2002, when the spread shot up to 200 basis points only to be walked back down by disappointing data in subsequent months. So far, the dollar’s fall has been gradual, and volatilities have been low. The reason I say that is that we took a risk with the insertion of our reference to a “considerable period,” not a risk so far as economic policy or monetary policy were concerned but a risk that what we said could significantly erode the credibility of this institution, with negative effects. In my judgment, what we have to do at this stage really rests on how best to disengage ourselves from this problem with minimal negative effects and, I hope, major positive effects. The problem in acting on that belief, however, is that if we are wrong the consequences will be quite negative, to say the least. It’s only five lines:  “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Before we act, though, we have to be reasonably convinced that it will not make our job on monetary policy, which is the most important issue here, more difficult to implement because we’ve set up barriers to our ability to function effectively. Yet I would submit to you that the strongest aspect of our monetary policy had to do not with the forecast or the expectation of the most likely outcome but with that low probability, high difficulty problem. But with the bailout of Resona Bank, the improving economic outlook, and the write-offs taken by most of the major banks since then, bank equity shares have risen sharply. At this stage the usual lag between productivity growth and its effects on real compensation is likely to result in increasing incomes and thus provide a fairly solid base for further growth in consumer spending as the impact of earlier tax cuts fades. The wealth effect, which has been a drag on spending for quite a long period of time, is now back to neutral or possibly has turned positive; and in my view, the consumer debt service burdens that one hears about from most of our private-sector colleagues are really being overstated. The first signs of emerging trouble are likely to be in the form of increases in unit labor costs; and with profit margins currently at high levels, those increases may be absorbed for a while in weaker profit margins, which is probably not a bad forecast at this stage.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Treasury yields have been edging lower since January and declined sharply on March 5 after the latest employment report. Some investors believe that yields should be much higher at the long end of the curve, but they are battling a countervailing force that should not be underestimated—namely, the very attractive yield pickup between the financing rate and the return on longer-term securities. Although all of the equity indexes started the year strong, the weakness in the past few weeks has now put all of the major U.S. indexes into negative territory for the year to date. If that is indeed the case, it may be that the weakness in January and possibly in Committee members have increasingly discussed the possibility that the persistence of low market interest rates is fostering increased efforts to reach for higher yields in financial clearly, the longer we maintain very low interest rates, if indeed there is significant reaching for better yields, the more the liability side of business balance sheets is going to be peppered with securities that may not be all that viable in a rising interest rate environment. The difficulty that I have with tightening any time soon is that the economy may not yet have reached the point where we can confidently say that this recovery is fairly solid and robust going forward, even though the current data clearly are exhibiting considerable strength. The sole reason I would argue for not moving is to avoid creating momentum toward a policy action if, indeed, the economic expansion is slowing down.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The congestion also caused a rise in fails for this issue, and to a lesser extent some other on-the-run issues, though aggregate fails are still significantly below where they were last summer, when the May ten-year note was in short supply. At least in this very recent period, the improved economic prospects in the United States and higher yields have outweighed worries about the current account imbalance. This is not unusual because we’ve had a very shallow recession and we’re not getting the usual rebound in any respect, with the exception of the very strong growth in profitability. And as I’ve argued in certain speeches recently, what we are failing to do in this country is to raise the degree of skill in the workforce as a whole sufficiently quickly to create a more balanced skill supply–demand situation  and in the process to remove the surplus of the lesser skilled so that we end up with an overall balance. I’m wondering whether or not the differential pressures of stronger wage growth in skilled areas and weaker wage growth in lesser-skilled areas create problems in doing this type of evaluation. And it turns out that two-thirds of that rise is reflected in higher unit profits and that actual underlying unit costs are rising very modestly, the result of a combination of declining unit labor costs and declining unit interest costs, offset in part by rising costs of energy, indirect business taxes, and business transfers.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " All of this says, at the end of the day, that the U.S. current account deficit is rising as a percent of our GDP, or in a certain sense as a percent of world GDP, implying that we must be getting comparably increasing surpluses elsewhere in the world. The type of rate volatility I will be describing is very short term:  intraday standard deviations of the funds rate around the daily effective rate and the deviation of the daily effective rate from the funds target. This graph shows the regular spikes associated with the year-end, which have now all but disappeared, as well as the somewhat higher volatilities in the fall of 1998.   in basis points, from the fed funds target. And fourth, at the margin, the Desk is probably intervening more often now than it did in the late ’80s or early ’90s, given the explicit rate targeting regime—though this does not explain the continued decline in volatility since 2000. Indirectly, low rates have lifted reserve requirements (by boosting growth in transactions deposits) and have created more room for banks to increase their clearing balance requirements consistent with their use of priced services. We are moving from the behavior of inflation as wholly the consequence of rising productivity, and therefore rising profit margins to increasing evidence of stabilizing margins, with some evidence that the stabilization is being induced by some slowing in productivity growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " During the intermeeting period, market participants scaled back their forecasts for U.S. economic growth—in part because of  rising oil prices—and the effects were reflected in expectations of a more gently rising trajectory for short-term rates, in lower bond yields, and in lower stock prices. Given the list of potential worries out there, including the upcoming election, high and rising oil prices, terrorist threats and other geopolitical issues, the onset of a tightening cycle, and the usual concerns about the durability of the recovery, one could reasonably make the case that vols are on the low side. It relates to what is lacking in this recovery—namely, a degree of enthusiasm on the part of the business community to move in advance of the numbers and expand   capital spending and hire employees before they are needed in an endeavor to be positioned to accommodate anticipated growth in demand and perhaps improve market share at that time. To the extent that we find a good deal more sluggishness in this recovery than can be accounted for by rising energy prices, there have to be other reasons aside from the shallowness of the recent recession. I don’t deny that, if we suddenly are confronted with exceptionally weak data or oil prices spike to $80 a barrel and we begin to see some significant weakening in the economy, continuing to increase the federal funds rate in the face of such developments would be a risky operation, even though I agree with Governor Gramlich, who said that persistent tightening would in general be the appropriate course for policy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Despite the Committee’s tightening of policy on August 10, yields fell across the coupon curve, spreads narrowed, equities rose, and asset markets continued to exhibit unusually low volatility. In part the fall in yields seems associated with the softer data—the revised and lower forecasts—and in part the persistence of high oil prices. Whereas earlier this year the correlation between TIPS breakevens and oil price changes was positive, it has now turned negative—again suggesting that the economic tax of higher oil prices is viewed as a more powerful force than its inflationary impact. This combination of low volatility, narrow spreads, stable or rising equity prices, and lower yields, even in the face of tightening monetary policy, is about as benign an environment as one can imagine. Second, the reserves need to be injected at a measured pace to avoid undue risks that some banks will end any day overdrawn or that some banks will accumulate so many reserves early in the maintenance period that they risk holding unwanted excess levels by the end of the period. But now that the trade numbers are getting larger and larger in absolute terms, their impact on GDP—other things being equal with regard to the ratio of imports to exports—is becoming ever larger and a source of increasing instability. We have to be careful largely because, while there’s no question that some softening has occurred in the overall expansion of the economy, the numbers in the Greenbook, if they materialize, are really quite strong, and in that regard it’s quite credible to forecast much more   rapid growth in employment than we have experienced in recent months.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Until Friday’s surprisingly strong employment data, market participants had focused more on signs of a slowdown in growth. While some of the narrowing is, no doubt, the result of a search for yield by some investors, the strong cash positions of the corporate sector, the repair to balance sheets since the fall of 2002, and improved situations in some major emerging markets—especially Brazil—suggest that the move can’t be categorized solely as a liquidity story. Equity prices have risen in recent days but they are only slightly higher for the year, and implied volatilities are a bit higher but not materially so. The Canadian dollar is at its strongest level since 1992; the Swiss franc is at its highest level since 1996; and the British pound a week or two ago hit its highest level since the ERM crisis of 1992. If we project continued low core inflation because of a 2¾ percent projection for structural productivity growth and that growth is in fact at 2 percent or less, inflation expectations will rise, bond yields will rise, and asset prices will fall, as, of course, will the dollar in that context. Should inflation expectations rise, the higher the funds rate, the better position monetary policy will be in to address unexpected inflation increases. If we signal today a pause for December, the ten-year note yield will decline, engendering an even larger correction should underlying inflation unexpectedly rise in the months ahead.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " With the tightening cycle advancing in the United States, short-term rates—represented by the solid red line—are now higher than in the euro area. With economic data in Europe showing sluggishness and with the strength of the euro adversely affecting export prospects, the ECB’s earlier expected tightening has been priced out, and many in the market are talking about a possible easing. But there, too, dollar interest rates are higher by about ½ percentage point—with the most recent widening driven almost entirely by a fall in German yields, as recent data disappointed. Japan, on the other hand, has not    intervened, perhaps in part because the rise of the Korean won and other currencies means that Japan’s effective exchange rate has not risen as much as the yen’s bilateral rate against the dollar. Implied volatilities continued at very low levels, and the price of oil continued to fall while prices of equities rose. This time, without the typical rebound, we’ve been getting a set of endogenous forces that impacted with modest exogenous forces to produce not very great changes in the economy. I’m merely suggesting to you that if our paradigm—which specifies that slowed productivity does not affect prices until it takes its full cut out of profit margins—is wrong and we end up with rising unit labor costs and rising inflation, we will be very pleased that we did, in fact, move the rate structure up.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I have always presumed, judging from the experience especially of recent years, that we have all concluded that low inflation—having created a certain degree of lower risk and greater stability—has enhanced the real economy in a manner which our experiences with high inflation did not. So I would say that the first principle we ought to agree with around this table is that the evidence, as best we can judge, conclusively indicates that a low-inflation environment has the highest probability of creating maximum sustainable long-term growth. If we decide, as I have a suspicion that future FOMCs will eventually come to decide, that asset prices are a relevant consideration—not necessarily to capture bubbles or what have you, but to try to mold a level of financial stability that cannot be achieved without advertence to asset prices—I suspect that that particular process will be coming onstream. The point is that we knew in retrospect that the economy was tilting downward, but there were innumerable occasions when inflationary imbalances were building up and the economy didn’t turn     down. I’ve been very surprised and extraordinarily pleased with our ability over the past several years to get acceptance of the notion that price stability is a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth. As I’ve mentioned at previous meetings, the Desk confronted higher funds rate volatility over the summer as the market bid up rates ahead of expected increases in the target.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " At the Committee’s last meeting I characterized markets in the preceding weeks as “more of the same,” inasmuch as trends, such as the gradual rise of short-term interest rates, a flattening yield curve, narrowing credit spreads, and low volatilities, were continuing their well-established patterns. Receiving no clarification on either point, the market pushed out the length of the tightening cycle and, at times, even the pace—with both anecdotal comments and some fed funds futures reflecting a stronger sense that the Committee might at some point ratchet up the pace of tightening to 50 basis points. I should also note that the dollar has been firmer against the euro and other major currencies the past few days, which may suggest a bit of risk aversion, as the possibility of a more aggressive tightening cycle is causing a reassessment among the large contingent of dollar shorts. I won’t go through them in any detail but would only point out the following: (1) they are still at very low levels; and (2) there are signs for both equity and swaption vols that the downward trend is confronting a bit more headwind at these very low levels, especially if the inflation and monetary policy outlook changes meaningfully in coming weeks. As I think Cathy Minehan mentioned         earlier, if we were to become a bit more aggressive in tightening policy in this context and it turned out to be wrong—in other words, if actual unit costs and price inflation simmer down a bit so far as core inflation is concerned—the damage to the economy and to policy would not be all that great.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The intermeeting period began with worries about building inflationary pressures but ended with a growth scare, as incoming data were weaker than expected and Street economists fell over themselves to cut their GDP forecasts for the first half of 2005. One important question mark for portfolio managers is whether the troubles in the auto industry are sector-specific or whether the general period of improving corporate balance sheets is ending, to be followed by a period of higher financing costs, margin compression, and generalized credit deterioration. It could very well be, for example, that January was up sharply, February was down, and March was down, and the average is still up 15 percent. If we choose the first—either pausing or making a significant change in the statement—and that proves wrong, in my judgment that will create a more significant problem for us than if we presume that inflation is the more critical ongoing problem, go 25 basis points, and maintain the language from our last meeting. If NAIRU [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment] means anything, it suggests that the current unemployment rate has to imply some level of market tightness that, at the end of the day, either has                     to stabilize the rate of increase in compensation or—in my view very much more likely—induce it to rise. But as inventories rise, the spot price falls relative to the futures price, making it even more profitable to hold more inventories.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The conclusions that I at least draw from looking at the history are:  that the current flattening has earlier precedent; that the current shape of the curve is well within historical norms; that inversions are rare; and that while an inversion caused by further tightening cannot be ruled out, the scenario that is at least as likely is for long-term yields to rise in response to higher short-term rates. But as the data deteriorated, the 9-month forward rate fell and is now trading below the cash rate as recent easing by the Swedish Riksbank and the expected easing in the U.K. has fueled expectations that the ECB [European Central Bank] will shift gears relatively soon. I am particularly concerned about it because even though we are publishing fairly large increases in output per hour—in fact 3 percent plus in the first quarter—when we disaggregate the quarters into monthly data, it’s apparent that the reason the productivity gains in the first quarter are as high as they are is that we moved into the quarter from a very high level. The problem with inflation, however, is that if margins start to come down and you are confronted with rising unit labor costs and you don’t have the buffer to absorb the rise, it does begin         to give you a cost-push type of inflation, the likes of which we have not seen for a very long time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The low level of implied volatility has made it cheap to buy interest rate options for hedging, and several mortgage hedgers have increased their use of option hedges after their dynamic hedging strategies produced poor results in the summer of 2003. Those improved data and statements by ECB [European Central Bank] officials that they were not contemplating an easing of policy shifted sentiment in euro area money agreement on 3-month euro deposits—the solid green line—rose sharply and unwound the ease that had been priced into markets around the time of the last FOMC meeting. The failure of the Diet to approve the postal reform bill and the upcoming elections will add some uncertainty in coming weeks, though most pressures on prices persist. And one of the serious questions is: Are we underestimating long-term demand growth so that even though there may be production out there, the gap is closing from the demand side? The problem that I think we have is that the impact from a slowing or decline in house appreciation— or more explicitly the effect of housing capital gains on the one hand and of stock capital gains on the other—would be a far greater contraction in consumption than indicated by a standard reduced form system, which we currently have in our models—namely, the wealth effect. So, we do have problems out there, and I don’t think we really have a great deal of confidence in the outlook implicit in this forecast of an ongoing, very smooth and very         impressive expansion in the economy.\n",

      " Suggested reasons for the fall include the possibility that the Committee might pause at this meeting or that the negative growth impact of the hurricane would dampen output and abbreviate the cumulative amount of tightening, even if the Committee were to move today. The yield curve, which had flattened on expectations that the impact on growth would dominate, steepened as concerns about growth were balanced by equal concerns about inflationary effects. With equity markets rising modestly, the VIX [S&P 100 volatility index] traded toward the lower end of its range and actually declined after the hurricane, as shown in the middle left panel. In contrast, the EMBI+ [Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus] has continued to narrow to an all-time low spread despite higher energy prices, a political scandal in Brazil, and uncertain elections in 2006 in several large issuer countries, including Mexico and Brazil. Theoretically, one can argue that the decline in economic activity as a consequence of a supply-side shock lowers wages, lowers compensation, and hence lowers expenditures. As a consequence, there’s going to be considerable confusion and much, much less certainty than has been exhibited in financial So we’re going into a period where the one thing we can say for certain is that the level of uncertainty is going to be rising, and it’s going to be rising on two sides.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I appreciate not  only that all of you showed up but, as best I can judge, that  virtually everyone else who was physically able to do so also showed up. That was despite some unexpected credit events, another hurricane, and increased talk about upside inflation risks. The 3- and 9-month forward rates rose 47 and 53 basis points, respectively, as market participants absorbed incoming data and, even more, comments by Committee members expressing heightened levels of concern about upside inflation risks. Now, with increased concern about inflation, the question of where neutrality resides is slowly being superseded by a new question: How far beyond “neutral” will policy need to go to dampen inflationary pressures? The rise of nearly 40 basis points in German yields has been particularly noteworthy and may reflect upgraded forecasts for European growth in general and improved sentiment toward Germany, notwithstanding a messy election outcome that leaves prospects for reform uncertain. The better economic tempo and heightened probabilities that sometime in the next 12 months the CPI will no longer be preceded by a negative sign are leading more investors to take a defensive posture toward Japanese bonds. The rise in real yields and the fall in equity prices for most of September and October suggest a tightening of financial conditions. I’ve had the vague impression that it’s been exceptionally tight over the most recent period, more so than I recall.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Sentiment toward the euro has been poor, given lackluster growth and the widening interest rate differentials with the dollar—but I’ll comment more on that later. The dollar strengthened in the early 1980s and also the late 1990s in the face of high and rising current account deficits. In other words, it is more expensive to buy credit protection against a GM default in the next 12 months, than it is to buy credit protection against a GM default over the next 5 years. Recent declines in volatility in both equity and debt markets reinforce this low risk concept and are consistent with the strong risk appetite in markets. We don’t know the cause of that falling growth rate, although greater use of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment may at least partly explain this development. The Argentinean debacle never resulted in the really awful consequences that were supposed to occur there, and industrial production is up sharply in Argentina despite all of their other problems. Obviously, their unit labor costs have stabilized, and the impact of their very serious structural problems seems not to be getting worse. It turns out that the critical word there that has been in dispute, and which Brian was unable to resolve, was the word “measured.”  And it had the advantage of not changing the rest of the statement either way—whether it was in or it was out.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The counter view is that inflationary pressures will forestall an early end to the tightening, much less usher in a new easing cycle. But as shown in the top panel on page 3, more recently the dollar has depreciated against most currencies, including a few Asian currencies whose exchange rates against the dollar had been somewhat sticky in the past. In mid-2005, the divergence cut the other way, with emerging markets outperforming and spreads narrowing to new record lows. While some commentators ascribed the narrowing of emerging-market debt to the search for yield, rising risk appetite, and “excess liquidity,” others pointed to improving fundamentals driven by higher commodity prices, better fiscal performance, lower inflation, and higher reserve levels that insulated these countries from external shocks. But this is the first evidence—at least that I’ve been able to see—that this is an overwhelming force because, irrespective of the other forces that drive the long-term rates, the spread between the thirty-year and the fifty-year is really quite pronounced. I’m curious to get a sense of what is our now retrospective explanation of the sharp fall in the year 2000-01 and the failure to start back up as the economy picked up. But it’s clearly now moved beyond its very serious difficulties and is likely to be a positive force, as indeed much of Asia and now, more recently, Europe is beginning to be.\n",

      " Of course, revisions in the data show that the recession was worse than we thought. I have a modest proposal, which is that if the BEA can restate GDP figures and firms can restate their earnings, the Fed should have the option to go back and restate interest rates from last time. First, regarding financial markets, I think the best thing to do is to keep our heads while all about us are losing theirs. The direct effects of the stock market are being partly offset by strong house prices, lower interest rates, and a falling dollar. It’s true that the volatility that we’re currently observing at record levels is feeding anxiety and caution, but volatility by its nature tends to be temporary. In particular, the revision has largely left intact the growth in productivity, which I believe in some sense is the most crucial element of the recovery and bodes well for both profits and economic growth. On the other hand, residential housing, autos, and consumer goods look very strong, and other areas like equipment and software seem to be improving. So I would indicate my preference to communicate either in the statement or in the balance of risks sentence that the Fed is vigilant and is willing and able to cut rates in the future if conditions worsen. In fact, one might interpret the expected decline in the future federal funds rate as being not a certainty of a small decline but a small probability of a larger decline.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The reluctance of firms to hire or invest is particularly discouraging given continued strong spending by consumers and the remarkable growth of productivity. As shown in the table on page 11 of Part 1, the rate of increase in the core PCE deflator is projected to fall from 1.9 percent in 2001 to 1.3 percent in 2004. Over the same period the core CPI inflation is projected to fall from 2.7 percent to 1.9 percent and growth in the GDP deflator from 2.0 percent to 1.4 percent. I think inflation as low as projected is potentially a serious risk for the economy. There’s an enormous amount of uncertainty to be reckoned with, and uncertainty suggests caution for central bankers as well as for businesses. One concern I do have about easing now is that it might exacerbate the imbalances in the economy by further heating up sectors that are already strong, such as residential construction and autos, while only indirectly benefiting investment and the labor For these reasons, I understand that we may want to wait to see how events unfold before taking further action. The strategy of preemptive strikes should apply with at least as great a force to incipient deflation as it does to incipient inflation. I’m a little uncertain and confused about the role of geopolitical concerns in the statement. In particular, if the sluggishness continues but the issue of Iraq is unresolved, would that preclude action?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I’d like to focus on a simple arithmetic implication of the unusual productivity growth that we’ve been observing, which is that it creates a wedge between the rate of output growth and the rate of input growth. As a result, we have a situation currently in which the recovery, measured in terms of output growth and spending growth, seems if not robust at least acceptable. If you thought that was the case and if you looked at factory utilization or capacity utilization across industries, you would expect to see most industries close to normal, but with a few sectors at extremely low utilization levels, suggesting that they have tremendous overhangs of capital. In any case, I’m more optimistic than Governor Ferguson that interest rate reductions might increase investment spending. Another positive factor I think worth mentioning is these very weak inventories, which suggest that if spending does increase it will be translated more directly into production rather than into inventory reduction. So in short, I don’t know about pumpkins, [laughter] but while the economy hasn’t fallen down the stairs, I think it could use a push to make it up the next few steps. I would be less concerned about retaining the bias toward weakness on the grounds that the market survey data suggest that there’s essentially a universal expectation that we will retain that bias even when people anticipate a 50 basis point decline.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Dino, on the mortgage-backed securities chart on page 2, I wondered if the sharp declines might reflect a decline in refinancing risks. Although the news has not been entirely positive since our last meeting, I think the risk of a double dip or worse has receded considerably. No doubt 2002 will go down as having been a very difficult year for the economy, but in every cloud there’s always a bit of a silver lining. On the real side, the productivity numbers we’ve talked so much about indicate a great deal of cost cutting, restructuring, and consolidation that will provide a basis for further expansion. The weakness in investment we’ve also discussed extensively; the one hypothesis is that it’s the response to geopolitical uncertainty and other kinds of uncertainty. So, while it has been a weak year, the upside is that a lot of restructuring has occurred to prepare for the future, which may help to provide a basis for good growth in the next year. As we go forward, I personally will keep a close eye on the risk premiums and other measures of stress in financial at this point are fairly problematic, given the uncertainty about productivity growth and so on, I think it will be important to keep a close eye on core inflation, which may be our best indicator of the output gap.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " One might argue that Glenn’s interpretation of the Taylor rule is correct—that there is no inertia in the policy rule and that there should be more in order to get more effect on long-term rates. I wanted to push you a bit more as to whether you had direct evidence on the permanence of MFP growth and on technological dynamism in the U.S. economy more generally. That theory says that perhaps the technological hype of the new economy was overstated and we might have a less exciting period now in terms of technological opportunity, which might lead to a slower growth phase in the near future. As my earlier question suggested, another possible explanation for the slow recovery is that there’s a lull in the technological opportunity for growth, a real business cycle. I showed in my dissertation that the firm’s optimal hurdle rate for investment not only increases with the degree of uncertainty, as might be expected, but also was higher the nearer the expected resolution of the uncertainty. Currently the geopolitical situation is not only one of high uncertainty but also one in which the uncertainty may be resolved at least partially in a matter of weeks or a few months. Given the ongoing slack in utilization of labor and capital and our projection that core PCE inflation may slip to 1 percent or lower, I would hope that in such a circumstance we would be prepared to ease aggressively earlier rather than later on the grounds that the risk of inaction at that point would be greater than the risk of action.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Therefore, market participants tend to feel that the risk of being badly burned in the near term by buying a ten-year bond is low, which I think is probably a mistake. Therefore, I think there’s a good chance that a reasonably successful resolution of the Iraqi situation will lead to strong growth in the second half of this year and in 2004. There might be a less than satisfactory outcome to the war or continuing fear of terrorism, in which case consumer confidence and self-confirming doubts might lead to slow growth in investment and consumer spending. Firms could find that their international markets are very weak, and they could continue to suffer from high energy costs and high costs for insurance and pensions. That combined with structural issues in a number of major industries and perhaps a lack of technological opportunities—or opportunities that are less good than hoped for—might result in profits that are not strong. On the one hand, we could get very good results in Iraq with strong financial market reactions, a boost in consumer confidence, strong anecdotal reports, and so on. I would like to caution against the situation where we are continually waiting for uncertainty to be resolved before taking action. If the economy is still struggling and if there is no significant improvement or evidence of increasing strength by our next meeting, I hope we will at least consider the case for easing policy at that time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Disentangling persistent from temporary changes in the rate of inflation is difficult, and measurement issues cloud the picture further. Nevertheless, the best guess is that underlying inflation has been declining recently. Inflation as measured by the core PCE deflator has been stable at 1.5 percent for the past two years, but the Greenbook notes that this stability is largely a result of increases in nonmarket imputed prices. Because monetary policy works with a lag, in principle we should be most concerned about the forecast of future inflation rather than past inflation. However, our loss function with respect to the inflation forecast error should be asymmetric. A 1 percentage point undershoot of inflation from the forecast, which would bring us to the brink of outright deflation, would be much more costly than a 1 percentage point overshoot, undesirable as the latter might be. Given that the risks to employment also seem to be downward, there appears to be a prima facie case for easing policy. More generally, as noted by Governors Kohn and Ferguson, deflation puts a floor on the real interest rate and can therefore destabilize and distort capital easing. For me, along the lines suggested by President Hoenig, if there is an argument for delaying further easing at this point, that is it. For example, if the two risks are in opposite directions but one is severe and one is mild, would that be a balanced risk or would it be—?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In a speech a few months ago I suggested that a relatively easy way to improve the transparency of the FOMC would be to detach these projections from the Chairman’s testimony and release them in a more timely way, perhaps with the minutes of the previous meeting. One, this combination of unusually high growth and low inflation would make very clear on what we base our balanced risks for growth going forward combined with our downward risks to inflation. Moreover, we have more than the usual degree of uncertainty about the amount of slack in the economy, which implies that we face highly uncertain downward risks to the already low rate of inflation. That means continuing our easy monetary policy and, even more important, using our statement to signal our willingness to keep policy easy so long as there is a risk of further disinflation and continuing economic weakness. For example, I think the May 6 statement left the mistaken impression with some that the Fed was concerned about the threat of imminent deflation as opposed to what really concerned us—namely, the possibility of a decline in inflation to a level that, while below the desirable range, would still be greater than zero. In issuing such guidance, the FOMC would not need to make any explicit commitment, only indicate that this working definition of price stability would be used as a guidepost in its pursuit of its dual mandate relating to price stability and sustainable growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The surprisingly good second-quarter GDP number looks even better when one takes into account the big negative contributions of the foreign sector and inventory investment, both of which should tend to reverse at least partially over time. Despite the good news, I think it’s premature to conclude that we should not consider further rate cuts, if not at this meeting then at some time in the near future depending on how the data play out. Moreover, because of rapid productivity growth, the gap may close very slowly in coming quarters even if output growth is quite strong. The longer-term issue can be summarized by the following question:  Where do we want the inflation rate to be when the economy returns to full employment and sustainable growth? A good bit of research at the Board and elsewhere has suggested that a positive steady-state inflation rate improves economic performance by reducing the frequency at which the zero bound is binding on the policy rate. I don’t want to take a stand today on what the long-run inflation rate should be, and that’s obviously something we should 2004 was 1.0 to 1.5 percent, somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast of under 1 percent. Government bond yields have risen a good bit lately; and while that rise is unlikely to derail the recovery, it does not help. That higher than the Fed would like, so the FOMC has responded to strong growth by raising interest rates to forestall any inflationary impact.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The technical distinction you’re making, as you mentioned in your remarks, relates to the idea that the economy is in a rational expectations equilibrium where everyone has the same information. As you probably know, one of the most studied questions in that field is whether or not people, using all the information they have but without being given information by the central bank, can learn—with, say, least squares or other methodologies—the rational expectations equilibrium. The notion is that because people do not know the true rule, they will behave in a very volatile way, which will induce volatile behavior on the part of the central bank, which in turn will make it very difficult to learn and so on. For example, our “considerable period” statement was intended to say—and did in fact say as originally written and before it was amended—that we think inflation will be low for a long period and if inflation remains low, we should be able to keep interest rates low. In particular I think the breaking up of the output and inflation risks was a very useful step, although we can do some fine-tuning there. We’re now, I hope—and it seems to be the case—no longer at great risk of deflation with a zero bound. One argument that has been made against moving up the minutes is that their release would create an unnecessary market impact. So count me as one who thinks that moving up the minutes would be a relatively effective and easy way to increase our transparency and to provide more information to the market.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The crucial question is, At what point should we begin to tighten? We don’t have much evidence to guide us on this, but let me offer a little from the only other jobless recovery of recent years—and the recession that seems broadly most like the recent one—the downturn in 1990-91. Employment kept falling after the trough in both recessions whereas labor productivity rose sharply. In the more recent episode, employment growth hit its minimum value in February 2002—also at minus 1.5 percent—three rather than two months after the trough date. In particular, the rebound in employment growth was much stronger in the earlier episode. In 1990-91, employment growth stabilized eleven months after the trough date; and by eighteen months after the trough, employment growth had reached 1 percent annualized. Moreover, most of this decline occurred after employment growth had turned positive. Because the post-trough recovery in the labor market has been so much slower this time around, the inflation experience in the earlier episode suggests to me that further disinflation or at least stable inflation may be on the horizon. But it is at least a little evidence that a jobless recovery is likely to be associated with very weak upward pressure on inflation even during the initial period after employment growth turns positive. The distinction is that we would be accommodative as long as inflation remains under control as opposed to as long as inflation is actually falling.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Both Taylor rules allowed for error correction terms—that is, a lagged interest rate in the equation. In particular, the forward-looking Taylor rule implies a much slower tightening process. Mechanically, the difference arises because the forward-looking rule puts a high weight on inflation expectations, and of course, using the Greenbook forecast we have a very low inflation rate expected over the forecast period. Which of these rules should we take more seriously? I’m not making a judgment here; I personally think that inflation will remain low and stable over the forecast period, but not everyone does. But if we do agree with that inflation outlook, then at least based on this estimated rule our policy tightening should be slower and more gradual than suggested by historical relationships or by the funds rate futures markets. Our current statement and both of the suggested statements have benchmarks in the terms “sustainable growth,” “unwelcome,” “desirably lower,” or “desirably higher.”  So that’s not the question; all of the versions have benchmarks. I like Governor Gramlich’s formulation better because his benchmark for output is not whether it is growing above or below the growth rate of potential but that it has a trajectory that leads eventually toward full employment. But in fact the statement suggested by Vincent does not do that because the forecast for output includes a reference to sustainable growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The cost of financing that deficit can rise or fall at any given point in time. One way that the cost of financing can rise is that we have to offer higher rates to attract funds and interest rates here go up. The odds that we have begun a strong and sustainable expansion have risen significantly. Because of the rise in growth, we’re going to see even more op-ed articles, wire stories, and editorials opining that the Fed needs to tighten soon to avoid a repeat of 1980s-style inflation. First, those on the Street and elsewhere who lately have been worrying about inflation have tended to point primarily to raw materials prices, which have been rising, and to the dollar, which has been falling. As we’ve been seeing, large movements of the dollar against major currencies tend to translate into smaller movements against the U.S. trade-weighted basket of currencies and into still smaller effects on import prices because of imperfect pass-throughs. I would just note that this prospective productivity Greenbook forecast assumes that productivity growth will fall significantly below trend in 2004 and 2005 as employment picks up, specifically to 1.7 percent in 2004 and to only 0.5 percent in 2005. The recent New York Times article by Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee argued that the rise in the unemployment rate in the past two years understates the degree of labor market weakness. However, even relative to a more neutral benchmark of 5 percent unemployment and a participation rate at its long-run trend, current household employment—the more optimistic of the surveys—remains some 2.9 million jobs below normal.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " This exercise shows us that achieving clarity and transparency for a large and diverse committee is quite difficult. At the theoretical level, the constant interest rate assumption is usually not well defined in the sense that many forward-looking rational expectations models simply do not have equilibriums or they have multiple equilibriums under that assumption, whereas backward-looking models tend to diverge and have unstable behavior. It’s not really a very useful conditioning assumption, and therefore, I just warn you that there are some serious reservations about that approach. One of them is that it would be like a drum roll up to the minutes that would in fact exaggerate the impact of the minutes. Obviously, we can put in standard errors to make it clear that they are forecasts and are subject to error and so on. I think that’s an empirical question, and most of the empirical evidence that exists goes exactly against that. Using the GDP deflator to measure inflation and using real time data only, Lindner shows that when the Atkeson–Ohanian sample period is extended back to 1980, the Greenbook forecasts are 40 percent better in terms of root mean squared errors than the random walk alternative. For the period from 1960 to the present, I find that a very simple Phillips curve specification does not out-predict the random walk out of sample except at times when unemployment is at least 1 percentage point above its average for the previous six years.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The history of using the monetary policy instrument rate for correcting financial imbalances is a very checkered one, to say the least. So I think the question arises as to whether there is some other tool or instrument that we might use to approach the question of potential financial imbalances, and that’s what I’d like to talk about in my few minutes. Many of the questions and comments we receive as FOMC members have to do with perceived and actual risks to financial stability. Just to take a few examples, we have all on occasion been asked whether there’s a bubble in the market for residential housing; whether the narrowing of risk spreads on corporate bonds is justified by reduced default risk or is instead the result of investors reaching for yield; whether household and firm balance sheets will remain strong when interest rates rise; what risks to the financial system are posed by the activities of the government-sponsored enterprises; and how Basel II and other regulatory developments are likely to affect the structure and profitability of the domestic banking system. Second, there may be some confusion between high costs and rising costs, and of course, only rising costs contribute to inflation. There were arguments of substance on both sides, and to suggest that the arguments against are purely logistical risks giving the impression that our convenience is more important than revealing information to the\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Judging by the small increase in the TIPS spread, these increases are largely real increases. A second reason to plan to be deliberate in our tightening is that downside as well as upside risks to the economy do remain, in my view. We have seen only one month of strong job numbers, and although an unwelcome disinflation now appears quite unlikely, the labor market remains in an early stage of recovery, with essentially no increase in the employment-to-population ratio over the past three quarters despite robust output growth. With productivity growth still strong, a high rate of output growth as well as a conviction on the part of employers that rapid growth will be sustained is needed to support new job creation. From a risk-management perspective, as we begin to raise rates we should weigh the risk of significantly impeding the labor market recovery against the risk of having to scramble to adjust to unexpectedly adverse inflation developments. Besides labor market slack, the arguments for stable inflation also include the impact of continuing productivity growth on unit labor costs, the unusually high level of price–cost  prices, and the recent endogenous tightening of monetary and financial conditions, which I’ve already noted. Most important, if we provided quantitative guidance about our inflation objective, we would now be able to make a firm, highly visible, and ultimately verifiable commitment to maintaining price stability at this crucial moment in the expansion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Our policy actions, reinforced by innovations in our communication strategy, helped provide crucial support to the economy during a dangerous period. As an aside, there has recently been a bit of revisionism to the effect that our concerns with deflation a year ago were overstated on the grounds that the official statistics may have in some way exaggerated the true extent of disinflation. We thus faced the real possibility, whether remote or not, that the funds rate would reach or come close to the zero lower bound, a development that would have greatly complicated our subsequent policymaking. Avoiding those dangerous waters on the way to robust economic growth was an important achievement indeed. With nonmarket prices excluded, more than 100 percent of the acceleration in core PCE inflation between 2003:H2 and 2004:H1 can be accounted for by higher inflation or less deflation in goods prices, particularly durable goods prices. As it seems likely that goods prices would be relatively more affected by changes in the value of the dollar and in the prices of energy and raw materials, this pattern seems consistent with the inference that the recent increase in inflation is due more to these factors than to a generalized increase in aggregate demand or higher labor costs, for example. The fact that the recent addition of more than a million jobs has barely affected the unemployment rate suggests that many people stand ready to enter the labor force as conditions improve.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The economy appears to have lost some momentum, and unfortunately the recent slowdown may be more pronounced than can be accounted for by the rise in energy prices alone. For example, we would normally expect households confronted with higher energy prices to reduce their saving in order to smooth the impact of higher energy costs on non-energy consumption. Instead, the household saving rate has recently risen, hinting perhaps at a more urgently felt need to rebuild wealth in the face of a flat or would seem justified by their order backlogs, raising the possibility that the excessive business caution we saw last year is surfacing again. Some support for the business caution hypothesis is provided by the estimates of second-quarter productivity growth released this morning—2.9 percent in the nonforeign business sector and 7.5 percent in manufacturing—which account for a large part of second-quarter growth and suggest that firms are still focused on cutting costs. The Committee tends to focus on the core measures on the grounds that they are better indicators of the underlying inflation trend and more likely to influence long-term inflation expectations. But Committee members have also warned that headline inflation should not be ignored. Many details aside, the regression analysis suggests that core measures of inflation do seem to be better predictors of long-term inflation expectations, as anticipated, although their advantage is not in all cases large. If the economy continues to weaken, we may find ourselves considering whether slowing or stopping this process is warranted.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " This composite shock comprised various effects associated with the decline in the dollar, the increase in broad indexes of commodity prices, and the especially sharp rise in energy prices. The mixture of the supply shock and the ongoing cyclical expansion made the economic data particularly hard to interpret this spring. We argued on that basis that both the rise in inflation earlier this year and the soft patch in economic activity in June were likely to prove transitory. Both of these forecasts have worked out pretty well, supporting the view that shocks to aggregate supply were indeed the principal reason that inflation in the first half was higher and growth lower than had been expected. The dollar has been roughly stable all year, and the rise in import prices accordingly has decelerated. Oil prices are still rising, and their volatility as well as their level may have a damping effect on the economy. However, about three-quarters of the increase in near futures crude oil prices since late last year had already occurred by last May, and refinery margins have fallen. Of course, further rises in oil prices or of the supply shock will afford us increasingly greater clarity about the underlying strength of this expansion. If job growth continues at the pace of the past few months, I think we would have grounds for concern about both business confidence and the prospects for household spending. As we go forward, however, we should remain flexible in slowing or speeding up the   process as dictated by incoming data.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Oil prices notwithstanding, the odds that the economy will continue to grow above trend and that core inflation will remain low and stable seem reasonably good. Growth has been solid this year despite the headwinds created by rising energy prices and a widening trade deficit. By the magic of GDP growth arithmetic, even if oil prices and the trade deficit do not improve at all in 2005, so long as they don’t worsen significantly, growth next year will receive a net boost. Aggregate supply constraints should not be a problem for the expansion either. Job creation last month was substantial, but the increase in the labor force was even larger according to the household survey. The number of people working part time for economic reasons remains high, and the number of individuals who are not in the labor force but report that they want jobs increased by a half million last month, according to the Greenbook supplement. It’s also interesting that, since the last FOMC meeting, both nominal bond yields and TIPS inflation compensation have been negatively correlated with oil prices, suggesting that investors are concerned more about the growth effect of higher oil prices than about any possible inflationary effects. In light of the energy situation and the fact that we are at a stage of the cycle in which inflation pressures sometimes increase, stabilizing core inflation is important to anchor inflation expectations more firmly and to provide a sound basis for the sustained expansion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Overall, the intermeeting data suggest a pickup in the pace of the expansion in output and employment, with fewer downside risks to growth. Inflation risks have also moved slightly to the upside, I think, but falling oil prices help to make any really significant increase in inflation unlikely. An important question for monetary policy is how long the current configuration—the large current account deficit and relatively slow adjustment of the dollar and real interest rates—can persist. However, in part because of the financial crises of the 1990s, emerging-market economies are either unable or unwilling to accept large capital inflows, resulting in an economically perverse situation in which countries like Korea, Brazil, and Argentina have become significant exporters rather than importers of financial capital. However, while a slow unwinding of the current account deficit and relatively gradual adjustment of the dollar may be the most likely outcome, in a world of herding and momentum trading, financial accidents can happen. A higher rate makes short-term dollar assets more attractive and raises the cost of shorting the currency, lowering the risk of a sudden depreciation. And although I don’t have a lot of market contacts, a number of them did contact me at those times and asked, “What’s going on here?”  Second, I would put more weight on the notion    that we all have to go out and give speeches and talks and answer questions and we worry about giving the wrong signal and confusing the market.\n",

      " Some have cited a possible slowdown in labor productivity growth as an upside risk for inflation on the grounds that slower productivity growth implies a more rapid rise in unit labor costs. And even though the expected slowdown in structural productivity growth will put upward pressure on prices, the staff expects the impact on inflation of that productivity slowdown to be offset by other factors like declining energy prices and a stabilization of the dollar. To summarize, the Greenbook’s baseline forecast shows that some slowing of productivity growth, at least, is not inconsistent with continued stable inflation. If a slowing in productivity growth occurs that is both perceived as permanent and is also largely unexpected by households and firms, then stock prices should fall and households should tend to offset the inflationary impacts of the productivity slowdown. As a consequence, as        illustrated in chart 6 of the Bluebook, the optimal policy response to a permanent slowdown in productivity growth may well involve a slower pace of tightening rather than a faster one, despite a possible short-run bump in inflation. This scenario is just a mirror image of the post-1995 experience in which a perceived increase in secular productivity growth sparked a stock market boom and rapid growth in spending, and hence was not disinflationary, despite the fact that unit labor costs declined. If the slowdown is judged to be permanent, however, the failure of aggregate demand to adjust would suggest that households and firms anticipated the slowdown, while the staff was too optimistic.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Still-strong productivity growth and subdued wage increases have been sufficient to induce some recent deceleration in unit labor costs. Prices of imported consumer goods have also been remarkably tame, rising about 1 percent in the year to January despite the fall in the dollar. Inflation in services is stable, and far future inflation compensation, which effectively strips out oil effects, has not risen. How serious is the inflation risk posed by rising commodity prices? Instead, recent commodity price increases seem to be largely the result of economic developments unrelated to U.S. monetary policy, which I would call supply shocks, although without disagreeing with President Poole. [Laughter] In the case of oil, for example, international agencies have recently revised downward their projections of non-OPEC production while increasing their estimates of global demand for crude, reflecting in part the           likelihood that growth in demand this year will be disproportionately concentrated in energy-inefficient countries, such as China. The weak dollar, which I suspect is responding more to the current account situation than to monetary policy per se, is also affecting the oil price. Since 2000, oil prices have risen 98 percent in dollar terms, but they have also risen by 45 percent even in euro terms and by 76 percent in yen terms. For example, the staff estimates that even in a full employment situation, in which firms have some pricing power, a 1 percent increase in the core PPI for intermediate goods should result in less than a 5 basis point increase in the core CPI.\n",

      " Financial markets were characterized by a continuation of the fairly benign trends that we have observed over the past few months, with narrow spreads, low volatilities, strong equity markets, and flat yield curves—all set against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Note that defaults typically start increasing a couple of years before the onset of recession, which is not surprising since the weakest corporations are less able to absorb a change in business climate. The economy appears to be quite strong, but my sense is that most people feel that risks on that score are relatively balanced, which I take to imply that, after being strong in this quarter, growth will slow to something closer to a more-sustainable pace in the remainder of the year. Perhaps the leading source of uncertainty on the output side is the housing market, but I was reassured to hear that most participants think that a decline in housing will be cushioned by strong fundamentals in terms of income, jobs, and continuing low interest rates. There was some discussion about shortages of more highly skilled workers, which presumably might affect wages at  some point but apparently has not so far; and there was additional discussion of productivity gains, which are helping to keep unit labor costs down and to support growth. Still, I took from the group some sense of at least a slight upside risk to inflation, reflecting the increasing resource utilization; the fact that inflation is somewhat on the high side of what many people describe as their comfort zone; and the fact that, if inflation does rise, there will be costs to bringing it back down and maintaining our credibility.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In the euro area, forward rates continued their steady upward climb as growth forecasts increased, business confidence improved, and the European Central Bank signaled that more tightening was likely. At the macro level, most forecasts have the United States slowing down in the second half while Japan and Europe do not slow, even if in level terms the United States is still growing faster. Besides the positive terms-of-trade shock, the Canadians have both strong growth and low inflation and something we don’t have:  a current account surplus and an ongoing budget surplus that is being used to pay down debt. So far we are seeing, at worst, an orderly decline in the housing market; but there is still, I think, a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly. Energy prices are obviously a negative for consumption in level terms, but we have had a big drag on consumption for the past two years from increasing energy prices, and so if energy prices do stabilize, the drag will actually be less in 2006 than in previous years. Finally, as a number of people have noted, although we do not have an official definition of price stability, we are at the upper level of what might plausibly be called the region of price stability, and further increases will be difficult and potentially costly to reverse.\n",

      " Not surprisingly, the high beta markets that appreciated the most also fell the most. Of course, when volatility begins to rise, intermediaries such as investment banks show an increase in value at risk that they wish to reduce. Implied volatility has remained at very low levels despite the excitement elsewhere. The red dots cover the more recent period, and they show six observations with very large forecast errors, of which four were associated with high levels of fed funds volatility. At different times there was uncertainty about the pace and extent of the tightening, and yet those  As for the turn in metals, can you talk about the relative importance of risk factors, higher interest rates, and inflation expectations? It’s getting more and more difficult to forecast, and there are certainly risks both to the upside and to the downside. Some took the view that it was slowing more or less as expected, whereas some thought the slowing was somewhat worse than expected—certainly that’s a source of downside risk. To name a few, the job market remains good, unemployment insurance claims are low, unemployment is low, and I suspect that wages and incomes will start to rise sometime soon. Obviously we have to look for more information, but in our public utterances going forward we should be somewhat more balanced about the risks and also somewhat more uncertain about where we’re going in the future.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " These volatilities rose after your May meeting and peaked around the time of your volatilities (the blue line) declined sharply from more than 35 percent to below 20 percent. Although a tad higher than the very low levels observed earlier this year, the VIX is well off its highs and below its long-term historical average. In that scenario, risk appetite is still ebbing even if that is not showing up in wider spreads or higher volatilities. I agree with most of what I heard around the table, which is that there is evidence of slowing but, except for the residential construction sector, it is not yet at all definitive that we are falling below potential growth rates. One indicator of that is the share of goods that have price increases or price increases above a certain level. In just examining clues, I think that acceleration might say something about international competition, the effects of the declining dollar, and the possibility that import competition has weakened to some extent and is allowing prices of tradable goods to rise a bit more quickly. To summarize, I agree with the sentiment around the table that there is a lot of uncertainty going forward, particularly in the housing sector, but that the inflation risks at this point are still dominant and that our policy action and                                                              statement should reflect the greater concern with inflation. Those are good arguments, but I would reply to him, first, that we’ve seen very low real rates in the past decade, a global savings glut and all of that, and, second, we have at the moment an IS shock of very significant and unknown size—the housing market, which is that’s, in fact, a more likely outcome.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Among market participants, September has a reputation for being difficult on portfolios, for sudden bursts of volatility that lead to risk aversion and wider spreads, and for sometimes spectacular blowups in the speculative community. But with political crises suddenly popping up in Hungary and Thailand, it may suggest that risks in some of these smaller, less-liquid market sectors such as emerging markets and commodities have risen. The yen’s nominal value has been falling against most currencies in recent weeks and hit its lowest level against the euro since the single currency’s launch. The real effective rate has been falling steadily since 2000 and is at its lowest level in more than 20 years despite the chronic trade and current account surpluses that Japan has generated in the interim. I do believe that the intermeeting news on inflation was more good than bad, particularly relative to the fact that inflation is a lagging indicator and that it would not have been incredibly surprising if we had gotten 0.3 readings the past two months. The extent to which we’re concerned about         potential recessionary effects should make us be a little more cautious and make us move a little more slowly. We can simply state that we have seen this decline in energy prices, and I think that makes our story a little more complete and makes it look more understandable to the public about why we think that inflation should decline slowly over time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Hence, volatility remains low and credit spreads tight, while some equity indexes rose to multiyear highs. The longer-dated forwards—as reflected by the solid red line—have declined more than 75 basis points from early summer to early October as market participants priced in an easing of policy for early 2007. When economic growth is strong, value stocks—represented by the larger cyclical companies—tend to do better because their earnings are stimulated by the strong economy. One interpretation is that, with economic growth slowing, the effect is biggest on cyclical companies, whose margins compress, whereas growth stocks are better able to maintain margins. The current months’ supply of homes for sale is greater than 6 now, excluding cancellations; the number over the past eight years has been very stable around 4, although before 1997 it was higher and more variable, which is a source of uncertainty. I agree with the Greenbook that growth should be slow, at least through the first quarter of next year, because of housing corrections, but consumption will probably pick up and lead to a stronger growth path after that. However, in the intermeeting period we can continue with our verbal tightening in the sense that we can emphasize our ongoing concern about inflation and the pace of change in inflation, and we can convey, those of you who believe this, that the risks to lower growth seem to have been at least somewhat moderated.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Certainly, the markets have been in this benign situation for some time, and we’ve been struggling with this question for several   years—why the term premium has been so low, why spreads have been so low, and why volatilities have been so low for this extended period. Looking forward, again to compliment the staff, I think most people around the table accepted the general contour of the Greenbook forecast—that is, moderate growth perhaps below potential for the next few quarters but returning to potential growth later next year, with risks to the upside as well as to the downside. Those who are more concerned about inflation cited the weakening dollar, accommodative financial conditions, and the expectation that growth will not be below potential for very long. I expect the unemployment rate to increase gradually but income growth and other factors to be sufficient to keep consumption above 2 percent, which is essentially what we need to keep the economy growing. The counter argument to that, which I should bring up, is that if people thought that prices were going to fall much more, then they would be very reluctant to buy. I think there are still indications of a mild deceleration in prices, and most of the factors supporting that are coming into place, including the slowing of rents, the improved energy situation, some increase in slack, and expectations, which include a five-by-five-year expectation which has come down about 20 basis points since we stopped raising rates in August.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The other question is about exhibit 8, where you consider a simulation with a decline in productivity and an increase in labor participation and you get a higher rate of core inflation. Some, but not all, members agree with the contour of the Greenbook that has economic growth somewhat slower in the near term, strengthening later this year, with a modest increase in unemployment. The Committee is generally more optimistic about potential growth than the Greenbook, mostly because the members assume that labor force growth will be greater than the Greenbook assumes. Most still expect gradually slowing inflation but are cautious and consider upside risk significant, perhaps even greater than late last year. In particular, a lot of the spending recently was for durable goods, which tend to be more negatively auto-correlated—that is, they tend to drop more quickly when they are high in the short run. The lesson I would take from it is that, if you do talk about the importance of low and stable inflation, which is certainly a good thing to do, you also make the point that we are, of course, committed to our dual mandate and that one of the principal reasons that we seek price stability is to strengthen the real economy. But I do think that this is, as President Yellen called it, low-hanging fruit in the sense that it’s something we could use to increase our communication and transparency in a fairly low risk way.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Most participants today agree that growth looks as though it’s going to be slower, but there is some diversity of opinion about how persistent the slowdown would be. Many people have marked down growth expectations for the remainder of the year, and there was a general sense that the uncertainty about growth prospects and downside risk have increased. Housing remains weak, and some participants noted the risk that problems in mortgage and credit markets and increased foreclosure rates might contribute to further weakness. The slowdown in capital investment drew more concern, in part because it has proved difficult to explain. Several participants pointed to potential financial risks, including possible knock-on effects of the subprime mortgage problems and the possibility of the drying up of currently abundant liquidity and financial markets. The views of most participants were that upside inflation risks still outweigh downside risks to output, that uncertainty has increased, and that the tails of the distribution have become fatter. Another possibility in the current environment goes back to my Ph.D. thesis on the effects of uncertainty on investment, which found that greater uncertainty can make people delay their commitments. Again, I’ve marked down my growth expectations only a bit, but if we were handicapping recessions, I’m afraid that risk has probably gone up a bit. First, there seems to be a pretty good chance that potential output growth is lower than in the past; and almost by definition, if growth is lower, then the chance of negative quarters is greater.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Several participants seem a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook on potential growth and the NAIRU, although there are risks. Although there are some potentially significant downside risks to output, arising particularly from the housing sector and the possible spillover to consumption, the group still appears to view a failure of inflation to moderate as expected to be the predominant risk to longer-term stability. There was a jobless recovery in ’91-’93 in which unemployment remained high even though growth was picking up, and we had a midcycle slowdown in ’95 and ’96, which was relatively short and not very severe, in which the unemployment rate got temporarily ahead of growth. I think that assumption is reasonable, particularly since the staff is not exceptionally optimistic about potential growth and, therefore, that particular source of error is moderated. So if labor hoarding explains the failure of Okun’s law, then we may soon see some gradual rise in the unemployment rate, which would also be consistent with the view that the staff has taken that a good bit of the slowdown in productivity is cyclical. Also, the quarterly average of medical cost increases was much more moderate than in the first two months, which suggests that maybe this risk is not as serious as it may have looked. So I am quite comfortable with the view expressed around the table that, although inflation looks to be stabilizing and perhaps falling slowly, there are significant risks to inflation and we should take those very seriously.\n",

      " We will have an opportunity later in the fall to say goodbye to Cathy more officially, but I think this will be a good opportunity to thank you for your collegiality and for thirteen years of tremendous contributions to the FOMC. However, a few of you have suggested that some of the recent improvement in core inflation is transitory, and they noted upside risks, including resource utilization, possible pass-through from energy and commodity costs, slower productivity growth, and the possible effect of high headline inflation on inflation expectations. Judging from the FOMC’s 2009 projections, most of us think that the natural rate may be a bit below 5 percent, and I would note that the unemployment rate was in the mid to low 4s for four years in the late 1990s and has been in that range now for about two and one-half years. Another point to make here is—and I don’t want to get too distracted with this—that since there is a fairly stable wedge between the PCE and the CPI, we might be able to use the CPI in some of our communication as long as we’re clear that we are not picking and choosing as far as our objective and our definition of price stability are concerned. Assuming that we’re not too far from the steady state initially, which I think characterizes our current situation, it is evident that the third-year projections—or, alternatively, the third through fifth or however we decide to do it—reveal a lot of information about our views on sustainable long-run growth; our views on sustainable unemployment; and, of course, our views of what price stability is.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Unfortunately, against all good advice and after only eighty-two FOMC meetings—a record which to his credit he has achieved without prompting accusations of steroid use—[laughter] Vincent is insisting upon returning to civilian life. Despite lower household wealth resulting from weaker house and stock prices, consumption is likely to continue to grow as labor markets remain strong, real incomes increase, and gasoline prices moderate. Business investment should also grow moderately, although lower productivity and higher volatility could be drags on investment. However, higher risk premiums, tougher underwriting, and greater uncertainty may constrain housing and investment spending, leading to broader macroeconomic effects. However, risks to inflation remain, including the possible reversal of transitory factors, tight labor markets, the high price of commodities, and higher unit labor costs resulting from lower productivity growth. In the late ’90s, the pickup in productivity growth stimulated a very strong boom working through the stock market, consumption, and investment, so it led to an overheating economy, whereas in the earlier part of this decade, productivity growth picked up again but with weak aggregate demand. Another reason is that the statement “although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat,” if we follow your advice and put it after the new sentence in paragraph 2, will essentially say that the financial markets are the reason that the downside risks have increased, whereas there are other factors—the housing market, automobile sales, and things of that sort—that could be viewed as increasing the downside risks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Participants were unsure about how long these conditions would persist, but the repricing of risk seems likely to be persistent. The tighter credit conditions will very likely weaken an already very weak housing market, as nonprime borrowers are rationed out and jumbo mortgage borrowers pay higher premiums. Some of the key questions include whether the further weakness of housing will spread to consumer spending; whether credit tightness will affect sectors other than housing, including the household sector and commercial real estate; and whether the labor market will continue to slow. There is a general view that downside risks to output have increased with some very bad scenarios at least conceivable. If labor markets weaken, particularly if they weaken severely in certain local areas, it will hurt house prices through two mechanisms. But I don’t dismiss inflation risks by any means, and we know that policy changes can work through expectations as well as through resource pressure, and so I consider that to be a serious concern. The moral hazard issue is the following:  There is a good reason to allow some deviation of cash-based valuations from fundamentals because it creates incentives for providing sufficient liquidity and rewards those who have sufficient liquidity. I did not hear a great deal of opposition to the principle that the Federal Reserve at times should help markets function when they are in a state of panic or otherwise in serious dysfunction.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Some suggested that a risk of relapse remains, should credit quality worsen or further bad news be disclosed. There is not yet much evidence that this tightening is affecting business borrowing, however, although financial conditions may have somewhat increased uncertainty among business leaders. Consumer sentiment is on the weak side, house prices are down, and oil prices are up, which suggests some weakening ahead. Core inflation has moderated, and there was generally more comfort that this improvement would persist. Most participants saw inflation risks to the upside, but at least some saw them as less pressing than earlier this year. For example, commercial paper markets are working almost normally for good borrowers, the spreads are down, and volumes are stable. First, there were a number of reports of unusually large and unanticipated losses, which reduced the confidence of investors that we had detected and unearthed all the bad news. I agree with the Vice Chairman that the credit markets probably could stand the surprise, but they have become somewhat more uncertain, and I think their basic problem is macro uncertainty. First, in the economic growth paragraph, we have switched language from actions “intended to help forestall”—very indirect—to “should help forestall,” suggesting that we are now more confident in our ability to prevent bad outcomes in the economy. The question to ask yourself is, Given your most likely forecast, on which side are the largest and most costly deviations most likely to occur.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A weakening economy could cause financial conditions to worsen further, leading to a negative feedback loop, and indeed, there are signs of some broader credit deterioration. Export demand related to the weaker dollar and strong foreign growth provides some help to the manufacturing sector, although it was noted that other countries might not be immune to a slowdown in U.S. growth. Overall, most participants saw slower growth, but there is greater agreement that the outlook is in any case more uncertain. I would also argue that, in particular, the consumer, who of course is crucial to the expansion, is facing somewhat weaker conditions—including higher oil prices, less wealth from lower stock and house prices, and perhaps tighter credit—than was the case a month and a half ago. We had very weak growth in the first quarter of this year, for example; but even with the zero growth projected for the fourth quarter, we will see 2.2 percent growth in the first half of ’07 and 2.5 percent growth in the second half of ’07. The other concern I have is that, for better or worse, given our communications and market expectations, at this point a 50 basis point cut would be viewed as something of a lurch and might signal, as others have suggested, more concern or private information about the economy that we in fact don’t necessarily have.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Again, trying to bring together some of the comments, we noted that incoming data since the last meeting have been broadly weaker than expected, and anecdotes generally suggest slower growth, in some cases significantly slower growth. Together with financial indicators, weaker labor and consumption data suggest that the economy is at a risk of recession; in any case, it is likely to grow slowly for the first half of the year. I do think that there has been a significant deterioration in the outlook for economic growth and an increase in the downside risks to growth. I don’t think any of us would be happy to see a garden variety NBER recession; but if we had that, there would probably be a few benefits, including correction of some imbalances that we’re seeing in the economy and perhaps some reduction at the edge in the inflation picture. Furthermore, as we’ll talk about more tomorrow, to the extent that we decide at this meeting to take out some insurance against downside risks, then implicit in that insurance premium might be a greater risk of inflation six months or a year from now. There are a lot of interactions between the financial markets and the real economy that are potentially destabilizing, and so we are going to have to be proactive in trying to stabilize the situation, recognizing that we have a confluence of circumstances that is extraordinarily difficult and that no policy approach will deliver the optimal outcome in the short term. Conveying the message that the Fed will be active and willing to mitigate tail risk is critical for achieving financial stabilization, which in turn is necessary for achieving economic stabilization.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Housing demand and construction have continued to decline sharply, and house-price declines have been somewhat greater than expected. [Laughter] Financial conditions have worsened considerably, reflecting weakness in housing prices, and credit markets in particular are highly stressed and illiquid. Some noted the risk that continued financial turmoil could lead to a more serious and prolonged recession, implying possibly large downside risk to growth. It’s true, as President Fisher pointed out, that medium-term and long-term rates have not fallen because lower Treasury rates have been offset by higher spreads, but again, the question is the counterfactual. I think that lower rates have both lowered safe rates and offset to some extent the rising concerns about solvency, which have caused the credit spreads to widen. It can happen either by overall increases in the nominal price of oil, which are reflected in overall increases in headline CPI inflation, or by lower or negative growth in nominal wages. Now, if we have temporary movements in these relative prices, I think all the theory tells us that the best way to let that relative price change happen is to let the shock feed through; let the prices of energy, commodities, and so on rise; accept a temporary increase in headline inflation; and focus on making sure that the increase in headline inflation doesn’t feed through into domestic core inflation, say, through wages or domestic prices. If we think there’s more volatility in that, if it’s up or down, that would create more uncertainty about headline inflation and would feed through into that spread.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Most saw improved economic growth in the second half of 2008 with further improvement in 2009, although some saw more-protracted weakness. Financial conditions have improved in the past month, with financing conditions better, credit risk spreads coming in a bit, and both equities and real interest rates up since the last meeting. Some expressed the view that more-significant write-downs and financial stress lie ahead, as house prices continue to fall and the slowing economy weakens credit quality, and that the full impact of tighter credit has not yet been felt in the nonfinancial economy. Inflation breakevens showed improvement at some horizons since the March meeting, possibly reflecting lower risk premiums, though survey inflation expectations were higher. The staff projection for credit losses for U.S. commercial banks and thrifts, excluding investment banks, is about $215 billion for this year and next year and $300 billion if the recession is more severe. In particular, the fact that we have not seen any buildups in hoarding or inventories is a very strong argument against the idea that inflation expectations, hoarding, or speculation is a major factor in energy price increases. There’s a good chance that we will see further problems and further relapses, but we have made progress in reducing some of the uncertainties in the current environment. That is, there is more attention to inflation risks and dollar risks, and although our output risks remain quite significant, the balance is closer than it has been for some time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As a result, economic growth in the second quarter, though not robust, was likely positive, continuing the pattern of weak but positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2007. Participants debated how much comfort to take from slow wage growth, some arguing that, by the time wages reflected higher inflation expectations, it would be too late. Most saw inflation risks as now to the upside, with the primary concern being the possibility that inflation expectations could rise further as headline inflation rises and more costs are passed through. Moreover, even if systemic risks have faded, we still have the eye-of-the-storm phenomenon—we may now be between the period of the write-downs of the subprime loans and the period in which the credit loss associated with the slowdown in the economy begins to hit in a big way and we see severe problems at banks, particularly contractions in credit extension. Indeed, I think that it’s now appropriate that we begin, as some of us already have, to move rhetorically toward acknowledging that risk and agreeing that it may be at the point where it even exceeds the risk that we see on the growth side, although I think we’re very uncertain about that. If I were making a comparison of tail risks to tail risks, I still think that the inflation tail risks have not yet reached the level of the concerns I have about the financial crisis.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter, which suggests a campaign slogan for the Republicans, “The Economy:  It Could Be Worse.”  [Laughter]  The question, though, is whether this higher-than-expected growth rate in the second quarter implies that we are actually looking forward to a better-than-expected remainder of the year or whether this was in some sense a last hurrah of borrowing from the future. The unemployment rate, though, has risen as quickly as in previous episodes, and any look at the unemployment rate would suggest that this is something close to a normal recession dynamic. So just looking at the traditional indicators of growth and production, I think the best guess is for a slow second half, a slow beginning of 2009, and an unemployment rate that continues to rise from here. Therefore, I don’t think it is evident at all that we are in a financial situation that is conducive to rapid, excessive growth and inflationary increases a priori. The numbers are not too encouraging under the baseline scenario, forgetting about the more severe scenarios. We will continue to see that high level of prices being passed through into the core, as Governor Kohn noted, but I would argue that if—and this is a very big “if”—commodity prices do begin to stabilize within the general range of what we see now, I think that the inflation concerns will moderate over time because they will have lost essentially their driving force. In 2001, again, it was more than a year after unemployment rates started coming down, and payrolls began growing before the rates started going up.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I didn’t hear a great deal of change in the general profile, with most people still viewing growth as being slow in the near term but perhaps recovering somewhat in 2009. Another factor, which is becoming more relevant, is the slowing global economy, which together with the stronger dollar may mean that U.S. export growth will be somewhat less. The labor market is deteriorating, with unemployment up, although UI programs may play some role in the unemployment rate. Firms are continuing to struggle with weaker demand, higher uncertainty, and high costs. Manufacturing has been relatively stable to weaker, but we had at least one report of a survey that in the medium term the outlook is looking a little better. The significance of that for our deliberations is, again, that there does seem to be some evidence that, in recession regimes, the dynamics are somewhat more powerful and we tend to see more negative and correlated innovations in spending equations. So if I wanted to outline an optimistic scenario, it would involve stronger indications of stabilization in housing, which in turn would feed into more confidence in the financial sector and would lead over time to improvement in the broader economy. It is just as much a mistake to move too late and allow inflation, and perhaps even financial imbalances, to grow as it is to move too early and be premature in terms of assuming a recovery.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But the EMEs are now at a flashpoint in the financial crisis, and as I think Linda Kole will probably discuss, the urgency has increased, and the risks to the broader global economy are probably higher than they were a few weeks ago. Over the past six weeks or so, however, financial conditions have greatly worsened, and risk aversion has increased, despite actions here and abroad to stabilize the banking system. Equity values have declined sharply amid conditions of low liquidity and extraordinary volatility. Banks have probably not reserved sufficiently for the credit losses to come, and hedge funds will be hitting their net asset value triggers in greater numbers, forcing them to liquidate assets. The difficulty of predicting the course of the crisis or its effects on the economy has also increased forecast uncertainty. Consumer spending has weakened considerably and probably fell sharply in the third quarter, reflecting in part a recessionary psychology. This weakness reflects the same set of negative influences on consumption that we have been seeing for a while, now compounded by losses of equity wealth and confidence effects on prices, although lower oil prices may provide some relief. Although they had very slow growth, they never really had a deep recession or big increases in unemployment. We did our best to stabilize them, but I think that it was that run, that panic, and then the impact the panic had on these major institutions that was the source of the intensification of financial crisis.\n",

      " That being said, it’s obvious that the effective funds rate now is quite low, and given the amount of excess reserves in the system, we’re going to have to find other ways at least in the near term to address the economic crisis. The more clarity we can provide in that direction, the more effective our policy will be and the less problem we will have exiting from that strategy in the future. But if we decide to go in this direction, I do think that this might be a good time because it is certainly not a negative as far as employment growth is concerned in this context, and so it might be easier to explain. Furthermore, and finally, these programs obviously have different operational costs and risks, different risks of losses, different maturities, and most important, they present different issues with respect to the exit strategy, which we will want to talk about. This may be an excellent opportunity to do it because not only is there no tradeoff between growth and inflation in this context but also there won’t be any suspicion that we’re choosing a rate that’s convenient. There were requests for more metrics, more explanation, more criteria, more exit strategies, and so on, and I think those were all valid points. Finally, inflation looks set to decline significantly, reflecting falling commodity prices, rising slack, limited pricing power, and falling inflation expectations.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It is a tradition of central banking that we lend against illiquid assets when there is a panic run, and we know that panic runs are equilibrium phenomena and they can occur even though the assets are worth more than the liabilities. There is always the issue of liquidity versus solvency and so on, but it is not easy to make a clear distinction between lending against solvent but illiquid assets versus providing capital for informationally intensive agents, like banks. One of them is that we need to keep thinking about our metrics regarding the efficiency and efficacy of our programs—in particular, how the shadow value of duration or illiquidity in our balance sheet is matched against the benefits of a particular program that has certain implications for our balance sheet. Some participants expect a return to positive economic growth later this year, citing such factors as fiscal policy, lower oil prices, inventory adjustments, government efforts to stabilize the financial sector, and the possibility of improving confidence. Currently inventory liquidation is subtracting from growth, and so stabilizing final sales at zero by midyear, which seems like an easy task, would be sufficient to give us some positive growth. On the other hand, Debbie points out to me that the minutes from the December meeting had exactly this sentence about inflation—that some members saw significant risks that inflation could decline and persist for a time at uncomfortably low levels, and then similar language that relates to being below the sustainable level, and so on.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The first point would be a positive statement of the need for Treasury–Federal Reserve co-equal cooperation during this financial crisis, so that is a positive good and something that we want to continue to do. For a three-year loan, when the three years are up, if the value of the asset has fallen by more than the haircut, they will put the asset to the bad bank, and the asset managers of the bad bank will sell it or dispose of it. A notable development has been declines abroad, which have been exceptionally severe, and which, together with the stronger dollar, are hurting U.S. exports. Factors that might promote a weak recovery later this year or in 2010 include fiscal policy, monetary stimulus, improvements of financial markets, slower wasn’t much conviction behind this view, and some saw at best an L-shaped recovery. Risks clearly remain to the downside, and a protracted period of economic weakness remains a significant possibility, reflecting factors such as an ongoing lack of confidence in government policy, general uncertainty, need for economic restructuring, and the ongoing deleveraging process by both financial institutions and households. Most participants expect inflation to remain very low for a time, and some are concerned about the risk for deflation, including falling wages. We could hardly expect strong investment in the context of declining output, a postwar low in capacity utilization, credit constraints, uncertainty, et cetera.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We need to have a good sense of what our exit strategy is as soon as possible, both because we want to be able to reassure markets and ourselves that we are comfortable with where we are and because, if we do decide to become more aggressive and do additional purchases, we would obviously be much more willing to do that if we were quite confident about our ability to exit in a timely manner. The intermeeting period saw some tentative evidence of stabilization of real activity, or at least a slower decline relative to the earlier sharp contraction. To the extent that participants saw an upturn materializing, most thought that it would be relatively anemic because of factors such as financial headwinds, including ongoing deleveraging; the need for economic restructuring; slow global economic growth that may be lagging the U.S. cycle; and the high vulnerability of the fragile economy and financial system to shocks. Fiscal stimulus will support consumer income going forward, and the rising stock market and possibly slower declines in house prices imply that wealth is no longer dropping so sharply. Slack looks to be high and increasing, as reflected in high unemployment and low capacity utilization. So the combination of some potential stabilization in final demand and the working-through of the inventory dynamics does give some hope—again, with all the caveats that everyone has expressed—that we will see somewhat better economic growth performance in the next couple of quarters and possibly even the end of the technical recession by the fall.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But let’s not fail to take advantage of some improved operating process, if it gives us better results. Inventory liquidation continues, which is a positive for growth later this year, and financial markets have continued to improve. Despite this relatively good news, though, most saw the economy as still quite weak and fragile and vulnerable to new shocks. Housing has shown a few signs of life but is vulnerable to the effects of the rising mortgage rates and continuing high rates of foreclosure. Despite some improvement in new and continuing UI claims, and a less bad payroll report for May, the unemployment rate and the rate of job loss remained high, with little near-term prospect for improvement. Since the U.K. is viewed as having many of the same problems in terms of fiscal sustainability and the balance sheet that we have, the fact that those rates had risen no more than rates in Germany suggests to me that a lot of what’s happening in the U.S. is the result of a stronger outlook and a reversal of the flight-to-quality flows, which in itself is, I think, encouraging. We have seen some stabilization, but the evidence of solid stabilization or the beginnings of growth is certainly not here yet, and we should not overestimate that evidence. The longer you’re away from full employment, the worse credit losses will be, the worse hysteresis will be in the labor market, the worse income effects will be on consumers, and so on.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Households still face considerable headwinds, including slow growth in labor income, uncertainty about jobs and job security, declines in asset prices, excessive leverage, and tight credit. The more-serious concerns now seem to be in the nonresidential sector, where deteriorating fundamentals, falling prices, and lack of refinancing capacity are weighing down the sector. Small businesses In the labor market, employment data continue to be weak, but there is evidence that payrolls are stabilizing or at least falling more slowly. I think there may be some evidence, in fact, that we are getting into a more beneficial feedback loop, the opposite of the adverse feedback loop that we saw last fall as an improving economy raises stock prices, reduces credit spreads, and improves confidence in the banking system, which in turn helps the economy. Inventories don’t have to increase to improve economic growth; they just have to fall more slowly. So even if consumption is weak relative to some benchmarks, so long as there is improvement coming from higher asset prices, some improvement in labor markets, greater confidence, and              improving financial conditions, that would support growth in consumption even if the level in some sense is low. The level of long-term unemployment now is exceptionally high, and as we have seen in other countries, the loss of skills and loss of job attachment can lead to hysteresis-type effects, which can raise unemployment going forward.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although anecdotal information suggests that businesses and households remain quite cautious, a number of factors should support growth over the next few quarters, including reduced inventory accumulation, higher auto sales and production, modest increases in  housing activity and prices, some stabilization in household spending, better financial conditions, and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Activity in the nonresidential sector continues to decline sharply in most Districts, reflecting both worsening fundamentals and severe credit constraints. The labor market is very weak, but overall, as job losses have moderated and as hours have improved slightly and wages have improved slightly, labor income is beginning to stabilize, which is an important precondition for multiplier–accelerator developments next year. And there are other things going on as well, including developments in the GSEs, losses at the FHA that may force them to tighten their terms, and probably an increased pace of foreclosures as some of the moratoria and other delays end. For example, the UI claims, although falling, are doing so quite slowly, and we are all aware of the fact that the duration of unemployment is quite high, which is going to affect labor force attachment and skills and so on. I think the downside risks are still dangerous, because on the downside lies the possibility of renewed financial crisis, and, of course, the marginal cost of higher unemployment—or less employment—is greater when you’re starting from such an adverse position.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Global economic growth is picking up, more so in emerging risks to growth may be a bit smaller, most participants were not ready to revise their expectations substantially for 2010 from previous projections of moderate growth and continued high unemployment. Although there have been some significant improvements, these may not continue next year as the Fed stops buying MBS, the GSEs reduce their portfolios and tighten terms, the first-time homebuyer tax credit ends, and slow progress in mortgage modification fails to prevent another wave of foreclosures and distressed sales. Households were likely encouraged by somewhat better news about the labor market, but high unemployment seems likely to cap growth in consumer confidence and spending. In the labor market, elements of good news besides reduced job loss included increased hours, reduced unemployment claims, and more temporary hires. Extended high unemployment, which seems likely if growth is not much above trend, could leave lasting scars on the labor force. So, if you put together moderate growth, likely weaker productivity gains, some strength in a few individual industries—manufacturing and others—the presumption is that we will see some job creation and some positive payroll numbers pretty soon. And there are certainly risks associated with substantial further expansion of asset purchases, including destabilizing inflation expectations, causing commodity prices to rise, or causing the dollar to start to fall, all of which could lead to a reaction which would be actually a net negative.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Risks to the economic growth outlook are roughly balanced, with conditions in financial and labor markets posing threats to growth but the possibility of a stronger consumer and strong productivity growth creating upside risks. Substantial resource slack and slow wage growth may tend to push inflation down; on the other hand, inflation expectations may be less anchored and more disperse than they appear and could be vulnerable to the public’s concerns about the extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions that have been taken or to disorderly declines in the dollar. Prime age males who have high attachment to the labor force have not dropped out of the labor force, but their unemployment rate has jumped much more significantly than that for the labor force as a whole. The presentation yesterday about the progress being made on reverse repos and term deposits, the winding down of our liquidity programs, and so on shows that we are in fact, more so than some other countries, moving back toward a more normalized type of policy, which I think, when we are able to do that, would be very good news. I think it makes it a stronger statement because it could mean that, even if inflation is low and expectations of inflation are low, that if unemployment falls below 8 percent, then we’ll start to move, which might be possible but I wouldn’t want to commit to that.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Participants continue to project a moderate recovery, picking up in 2011, but with high and only slowly improving unemployment rates. Growth in output and the difficulty of finding further cost cuts might lead to more positive employment growth, but then the possibility remains that productivity gains will continue leading to slower employment growth. For example, on the one hand, emergency unemployment benefits may be increasing the duration of unemployment and raising the effective NAIRU. But concern was expressed about increases in five-year, five-year forward breakeven inflation rates as well as indicators of inflation risk premiums, suggesting rising concerns about medium-term inflation risks. In order to get the moderate growth, the 3 to 4 percent growth that people have been talking about, what we need essentially, and it is not yet demonstrably seen, is a handoff from the inventory cycle, from fiscal supports to sustainable growth in final demand of about 3 to 4 percent—in particular, consumption growth around 2½ to 3 percent, which is what the Greenbook is forecasting. So the bottom line from both my summary and my few additional comments is that I think we should be encouraged that the path of recovery still seems to be on track; that we look to be having greater stability in the financial sector and in the housing sector; that we are seeing a spurt of growth from the inventory cycle, which in turn will feed down the supply chain into other production.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Generally, moderate growth is projected for 2010, with slow improvement in the labor market and low near-term inflation risks. The most recent labor market report was mildly encouraging, and job growth might have been positive except for weather disruptions. Growth in wages and unit labor costs remains low or negative, labor market slack remains high, inflation expectations stable, and productivity growth accelerated. Fiscal imbalances both here and abroad could restrain growth if they push up rates, and on the monetary side, a long period of low rates may lead to increased leverage or financial imbalances even if they don’t cause inflation. Economic growth is where we were a year ago, and relative to the challenges we faced a year ago, I think we should be a little bit pleased at least. I note one serious weakness is the lack of income growth. Obviously, if we get stronger productivity growth and demand is not more robust, then we could have a worse outcome. The interesting result was that, although there was a big improvement in financial conditions through most of 2009, once you hold constant the improvement in the economy, financial conditions had become something more of a drag in the latter part of 2009 and 2010. That’s mostly due to quantities rather than prices, for example, the lack of rebound in securitization and the lack of rebound in lending.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The markets have apparently fully priced in default by Greece, so there’s a lot of discussion going on about how to address that concern, and, in particular, whether other countries that are similarly situated should take preemptive steps to forestall concerns about their fiscal situation. Retail sales, and household spending more generally, have recently picked up, despite sluggish income and wage growth and a still low savings rate. Delinquencies and foreclosures, which could be inadvertently extended by restructuring programs, will put downward pressure on house prices and consumer wealth. I think that reflects our tendency to focus more on forecasts—whether or not those are good forecasts, as President Bullard has commented—and that, in turn, has reflected our tendency to treat oil price increases as transitory, for better or worse. Looking strictly at the unemployment rate, some of these results suggest that we may be getting close to the point of tightening; for example, in 2003–2004, we tightened a year after the peak, and, at 7/10 of a decline from the      peak in unemployment; that would suggest something like late this year as the tightening point, which is certainly a possibility. Although, admittedly, it’s very difficult analysis to do, it appears that financial conditions are not excessively easy at this point, that risk premiums and spreads are not excessively thin, and that measures of leverage do not yet show any significant move in a worrisome direction.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The staff predicts low productivity growth from here, but productivity growth more in line with recent expansions, though good in the long run, could translate into weaker, short-term employment gains. Lower stock prices, the stronger dollar, and somewhat tighter corporate credit are negatives for U.S. economic growth, although lower oil prices and lower Treasury yields are a partial offset. First, very briefly, I want to say something about the labor market and the risk of hysteresis, that is, continued high unemployment associated with a permanent increase in the NAIRU, as opposed to a return to the NAIRU that existed before the recession. They confirm that the rate of outflow from unemployment declines with duration; that is, people who are unemployed for a long time obviously have a lower probability of leaving unemployment and going into employment. Although monthly outflow rates from unemployment, both at shorter-term and longer-term durations, are at record lows for the United States, the monthly outflow rate from unemployment in general is currently about triple the outflow rate of what Europe experienced in the 1980s, and, for the long-term unemployed, it’s four times the rate in Europe in the 1980s. But I think anybody seriously thinking about this has to recognize that that’s very hard to execute, because the increase in spending is today, while the have a situation in which increased fiscal stimulus may have diminishing marginal returns—for example, you may have fewer shovel-ready projects available—but, on the other hand, you have quite a bit of uncertainty about what a large program would do to market expectations. The risk that has gotten more attention—and President Hoenig has been particularly strong in advocating it—is the potential risk to financial stability from low interest rates over a long period of time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I propose that we continue to expand and integrate financial stability analysis into these meetings; that will be a natural concomitant of the expansion of our responsibilities under the financial regulatory reform bill, which we’ll discuss in September. Most participants expect the recovery to continue at a moderate pace, picking up steam over time, but there is a question about whether economic growth will be sufficient to achieve meaningful reductions in unemployment in coming quarters. On the other hand, positive factors include reduced investor concern about Europe, which has supported improvement in financial markets, and stronger financial positions of households and larger firms. The unemployment rate has come down largely because of reduced participation and a low ratio of employment to population rather than because of net job creation, and long-term unemployment remains a concern. It is uncertain how much of the higher unemployment rate reflects structural factors, mismatch and reallocation, and the effects of unemployment insurance. I’m not disputing the modal projection of increased economic growth in 2011, but instead I’m arguing that, with an economy that seems to continue to slow, it’s conceivable we might reach a tipping point that would shift us into a much weaker situation. With no progress being made on unemployment, it’s    understandable that consumer confidence would be low and that, in fact, we might be doing very serious longer-term damage to the economy because of the longer-term unemployment effects on skills and labor force attachment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A range of factors, including economic and policy uncertainty, risk aversion, low levels of confidence, and the weak financial conditions of some households and firms, continue to be drags on economic growth. Banks have been hurt somewhat by worse earnings, concerns about financial regulation, weak loan demand, and problems with the economy. Again, my first observation, essentially, is that the outlook really has deteriorated fairly significantly, and I am concerned about the fact that we are potentially approaching, as I said, the level where unemployment may not come down significantly or, as Dave Stockton mentioned, we might be approaching a stall speed that might cause the economy to fail to make further progress. My view, then, is that we need to consider seriously taking measures that will move inflation up from 1 percent or a little lower to something closer to what I think the majority of the Committee would view as a more appropriate longer-term inflation rate, something closer to 2 percent or a little bit below that. One is that there still is genuine uncertainty about the most recent economic data:  Do they, in fact, signal a more persistent decline in the outlook, or are the last few weeks more indicative, and will we see strengthening over the next couple of months? Low inflation is also costly, because it creates low inflation expectations, higher real interest rates, higher debt burdens, and has, therefore, negative effects on the real economy as well as being not at the level of inflation that I think most of us consider consistent with our mandate.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The recovery is continuing, but it was characterized by a variety of unappetizing    adjectives, including “lackluster,” “disappointing,” “slow,” and “moderate.”  An increased rate of economic growth in 2011 is generally expected, but there are significant headwinds, including credit restrictions, especially to SMEs; the need for deleveraging by households; continued severe weakness in housing and commercial real estate; the end of the inventory cycle; fiscal drag; and the drain of some demand growth overseas, among others. An important consequence of slow economic growth is that unemployment is likely to structural break in terms of the pace of the recovery of employment following recessions, and there is disagreement about the extent to which unemployment is amenable to countercyclical policies—some thought not very amenable, but others cited the lack of aggregate demand as a key source of slow employment gains and worried about hysteresis. So, again, the risks are somewhat asymmetric in that it’s difficult to address those downside risks, whereas the upside risks of too rapid growth or too high inflation within limits can be addressed by raising interest rates. But if you have tail risks, like deflation risks or a double-dip recession risk, then the potential benefits of avoiding a tipping point are understated by this kind of analysis. But another risk with greater odds of materializing is that the recovery could falter, and we could begin to see unemployment rising, and we could get into a more serious downward spiral.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nearly 25 percent of households are underwater on their mortgages, increasing the risk of defaults and foreclosures, and, consequently, further declines in house prices. Employers are more optimistic about sales and growth but still remain, on the whole, somewhat cautious about hiring and investment, although some around the table reported improvements on that dimension as well. European sovereign banking problems have created significant uncertainties, and these problems could be transmitted to the United States via money market funds, domestic banks, or changes in risk aversion. Merger and acquisition activity is up, deposit growth    is strong, but many banks remain low-rated and face challenges in commercial real estate and elsewhere. Finally, core inflation measures continue to drift down with the slowdown in price increases quite well spread across categories of goods and services and across different inflation measures. For example, in the labor market, even though we saw a weak job growth number for November, we’ve also seen declines in UI claims, increases in vacancies and hiring plans, reductions in layoffs and discharges, increased work weeks, some decline in long-   term unemployment, better surveys, and so on. The factors leading up to that were increasing confidence, sustained monetary policy support, and a sense among producers that they were running out of room to increase productivity gains. Given the risks that still exist in the banking sector in Europe and so on, we can’t rule out the possibility that we’ll fall back and suffer a further slowdown in growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In particular, the inventory of unsold homes, high rates of foreclosures, and tight credit continue to push down house prices, hurting household wealth as well as bank balance sheets, and unemployment seems likely to come down only very slowly. European sovereign and banking problems have been more quiescent of late but remain unresolved and pose risks to the U.S. through money quality and are making more loans, but they face problems, including servicing and mortgage documentation issues, loss of fee income, tight interest margins, and weak loan demand. Like all of you, I was pleased with the intermeeting data, and I think the economy is certainly making progress towards a sustainable recovery with fading downside risks, and that’s very encouraging. Real disposable income increased at only about a 1 percent annual rate in the second half of     2010, reflecting very slow increases in hours, low labor participation, and slow growth in wages. One proposal is the following, given that I think all the things that are affecting household spending are still relevant:  Where it says “business spending on equipment and software is rising,” insert a comma and then say, “though employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.”  That drops a negative sentence, and that’s pretty consistent with the suggestion from President Fisher, for example, about firms investing in order to improve productivity rather than to improve employment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I think, in general, more transparency within the Committee is better, but I can think of one issue, which is that we don’t want the dealers inferring too much about policy intentions from the questions on the questionnaire. Labor market conditions have improved as unemployment fell significantly, though payroll growth has been somewhat less strong overall. With respect to inflation, the most important developments were, again, higher prices for oil and other commodities, which have increased headline inflation and contributed to some increase in indicators of inflation expectations. Unemployment is down, although in part this improvement reflects fewer layoffs and exits from the labor force rather than new hiring. Some risks to financial stability have been noted, including greater leverage and risk-taking by private equity funds, increased speculation in commodities, reduced covenants on bonds and leveraged loans, banks’ exposures to Europe, and high farmland values. Some noted that ongoing slack in labor markets, limited pass-through of commodity prices, and stable inflation expectations should keep inflation trends low,     but others saw core inflation rising as economic growth proceeds. The alternative case, which would be to tighten monetary policy enough to avoid the increase in headline inflation, would require that we force down wages, which, in turn, would require presumably a significant negative impact on the economy. For example, our unemployment rate is 4.3 percentage points above the two-year average before the crisis, whereas the EU’s increase in unemployment is 2.0 percentage points.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " If we were to sell assets that quickly, we would be, I think, more likely to suffer capital losses, which are also not attractive politically. For example, copper is up 3 percent during that period, wheat is up about 3 percent, corn is up about 15     percent, but sugar has declined fairly significantly. Now, when I worked with his memo, as I will explain, initially I ended up disagreeing with it, but then I did some more work and I ended up agreeing with it. In thinking about that, I recognize that an objection to that would be that we should probably be using a higher unemployment rate and higher NAIRU reflecting unemployment insurance and some temporary factors and so on. An important observation here—and this came up in my earlier exchange with President Plosser—is that what I call the LSAP adjustment, which is the additional easing being created by our securities purchases, is going to be waning over time under the baseline Tealbook assumption that we begin redeeming securities at the end of 2011 and then have slow sales later on. The labor market is somewhat stronger, with payrolls and vacancies up and unemployment down. It was not clear that growth was sufficient to reduce unemployment, and deflation risk, although not high, nevertheless was building as core measures fell below 1 percent, and at that point, of course, headline and core were pretty close.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But “efficient implementation” means that we would have to judge that that smallest balance sheet version of the floor system is effective in maintaining the funds rate near the target, minimizing volatility, and achieving collateral benefits like improved payment systems and the like. I think one obvious argument—and I understand President Bullard’s point—for raising rates first is that if you rely on balance sheet contraction as your primary tightening tool, given market-based limits and so forth on how fast you can do that, then you push the first increase in the funds rate off quite a while potentially, and there are people, including President Hoenig and others, who think that the very low rate has damaging effects on financial stability. Most participants saw a moderate recovery still in train, strengthening somewhat over time, but most also saw some longer-lasting loss of momentum and economic growth since the end of the recession have been the exception rather than the rule, as financial and economic headwinds have been stronger than we thought or potential output growth is slower than we thought. Indeed, in some ways we’re lucky that the unemployment rate on net over 2011 hasn’t risen, and so we’ve maintained much of the gains from November to January, despite the fact that output growth has been below what we think to be potential output growth. One other thing to mention is that the financial markets really seem to have taken on board a greater weakness in terms of lower bond yields, lower stock prices, larger spreads, more risk aversion, and lower fed funds futures.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Participants were concerned about an apparent ebbing of economic growth momentum, notwithstanding the possibility that the reversal of temporary factors such as the supply chain disruptions and high energy prices could bump up activity in the near term. Conditions in the labor market remain weak, as unemployment has increased, participation rates have fallen, and the employment-to-population ratio is very low. Financial conditions have been turbulent, reflecting the European situation, the U.S. debt limit uncertainties and fiscal policy, the S&P downgrade, and increasing concerns about U.S. economic growth, both short term and long term. In Europe, rising borrowing rates for Italy and Spain threaten a significant widening of their sovereign debt crisis, with implications for global Reflecting this turmoil, bank funding conditions continue to tighten in Europe, and U.S. money     States, as several institutions have seen sharp declines in stock values and rises in their CDS spreads. The other thing that I found very striking, and David Wilcox mentioned this in his remarks, is that currently in the forecast the entire decline in the unemployment rate between now and the end of 2012 comes from the fact that unemployment insurance programs are being ended, leaving the unemployed to move from unemployment out of the labor force. It would be, “Based on its current projections, the Committee anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.”  “At least two years.”  How about “for at least two years”?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " First, with policy at the zero lower bound, we have had to be more creative and more unconventional in trying to find ways to provide stimulus. But to come back to the thrust of the conversation, while not many people argued that these were positively harmful—except to the     extent that if they’re ineffective, they would harm our credibility—the question that was raised was, how effective would they be? Clearly, there’s a lot of interest around the table in increasing our transparency, establishing more information about our objectives, and giving more information about our reaction function. Participants took note of continued slow economic growth and the increased probability of recession, which was put at about one-third by some models and forecasters. The reversal of some temporary factors that held back economic growth in the first half was positive, but financial stresses related to developments in Europe, and other factors, have offset much of the expected rebound. Businesses have become more anxious in response to increased recession risks and ongoing economic and political uncertainty, including uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy, regulatory policy, and financial developments. On the one hand, they have had—even more so than we do—the stress from financial conditions, tightening credit conditions, falling stock prices, weaker banks, and so on. In the household and labor market sectors, I think most of the indicators are suggestive of slowing and increased risk of recession in the near term.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The narrow way is to note that I think it’s not too controversial to describe our behavior as conforming to a version of flexible inflation targeting, which attempts to achieve a broad definition of price stability over the forecast horizon, but in the short term allows some flexibility for stabilization of the real economy. We have, for better or worse, given an estimate of the date at which policy will begin to tighten, and it would be very desirable for us to think about ways to improve our forward guidance, particularly in light of the fact that we’re at the zero lower bound and communication is an important part potentially, at least, of our toolkit. However, most participants saw near-term growth as likely to be slow to moderate, held back by continued problems in the labor and housing markets, low confidence, financial market volatility, and fiscal restraint. I would note that the unemployment increases are very broadly distributed between men and women, between college graduates and high school graduates, which makes it difficult to pin this on, say, construction, if women or college graduates are having the same proportional increases in unemployment as high-school-educated men, for example. The effect of that is going to make inflation more volatile and more difficult to predict, more linked to global conditions, and that’s going to complicate our lives going forward as we seek to manage both inflation and inflation expectations. The best way to say it is that our medium-term forecasts have inflation below target or at target and     unemployment well above what most people consider to be the long-run equilibrium level.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Factors likely to restrain growth remain numerous and include continued financial volatility—especially related to Europe—labor market dysfunction, the     weakness of the housing market, the slowing global economy, continued high uncertainty, wealth loss and deleveraging, and fiscal tightening. Growth forecasts are also made more uncertain by the difficulty of assessing potential growth as well as identifying the appropriate jumping off point for potential growth from the period of the housing bubble. Important questions are whether the drop in income and the saving rate are real and if so, whether the higher rate of consumption spending is sustainable, particularly in light of the massive $7 trillion loss in wealth. From that perspective, in terms of achieving both fiscal stability and feasibility of growth, we’re far from a solution, and given the incentives on both sides to play close to the edge, we should expect to see uncertainty and volatility for some time. President Kocherlakota raised some interesting questions about the wage data, but at least the data that I have seen across industries, although occupational data are limited, suggest that compensation growth has been exceptionally weak, particularly when it’s corrected for benefits and some other factors, which also suggests that labor supply is not a major constraint. Given weak wage growth, weak growth in unit labor costs, the fact that core inflation seems to be receding now that some of the factors that caused the rise earlier in the year are weaker, and the fact that inflation expectations seem to be well anchored at relatively low levels suggest to me that inflation should be moderate for some time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I recognize that releasing this statement is not without risks, market and political probably, but I do believe that once the markets and the public adjust and understand what we are trying to achieve here that we will be able to make policy more effective and more transparent as well. I would say: “Most participants would set a fairly high bar on further purchases if the economy continues to improve, but are prepared to take further balance sheet measures if it is judged that employment is not making sufficient progress toward our assessment of the maximum level or if inflation shows signs of persisting below its mandate-consistent rate.” So I’m saying that most participants would be prepared. Many people acknowledged headwinds to a stronger recovery, including the housing market; deleveraging, noting that high leverage before a recession often implies a slow recovery; financial conditions; and fiscal drag, although noting that the state and local fiscal situation may be improving slowly. There were a number of points made about the weak aspects of the labor market, including potentially a slower matching process; the fact that ratios of job seekers to openings, at 4-to-1, remained very high; the fact that much of the decline in unemployment over the last year has been the result of people leaving the labor force rather than finding jobs; and the fact that involuntary part-time work remains high. On the surface, the fact that income growth has been so weak, and that saving rates have come down, would bode poorly for continued strength in household spending because, obviously, barring substantial increases in asset values, which we haven’t seen, the lower saving rate can’t be maintained indefinitely.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It seems as though it goes the other way, because we’ve seen in recent recessions pretty strong GDP recoveries but surprisingly slow declines in unemployment. Volatility is much reduced, and confidence, I think, in that the overall strength of the U.S. banking system, in terms of its capital and resilience, is significantly improved from the dark days of the crisis, and the ability of our banking system to withstand a highly stressed environment is much improved. The progress in the labor market, as others have noted, has also been encouraging, including not just payrolls and the unemployment rate, but a variety of other indicators, such as temporary hiring, jobless claims, and diffusion indexes, are all pointing toward a stronger and more sustainable improvement in the labor market. From an unemployment metric, the peak unemployment rate in 1981–82 of 10.8 percent was higher than anything we saw in the more recent recession, but on an hours-worked basis, the worst peak-to-trough decline in 1981–82 was 5.8 percent. Almost everyone has commented on what we can call the Okun’s law puzzle, the contradiction between the slow rate of GDP growth and the decline in unemployment. So, bottom line—again, like everyone else, I see considerable improvement in labor remaining, including, notably, differences in alternative measures of labor input, the breakdown of Okun’s law, the basic question of whether aggregate demand will be sustained or even grow                                                more quickly going forward, and uncertainties about fiscal policy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Some participants were more optimistic, noting signs of strength and expressing increased confidence in the durability of the recovery, while others were less sure, citing factors like the confounding influence of the weather and noting that we had had false dawns each of the past two years. In any case, important downside risks remain, including the European situation and the fiscal cliff, both of which were likely to impede growth even if the worst outcomes were not realized, the geopolitics of oil, and perhaps a slowdown in Asia. If so, unemployment will decline more slowly in the future as the economy improves and workers are attracted back to the labor force. However, capital investment is aimed at productivity gains or gaining market share rather than expansion of capacity, and fiscal policy uncertainties may impede hiring and investment later this year. To the extent that the recent improvements in the labor market were a one-time catch up offsetting the unusual pace of firing in 2008 and 2009, then it may be the case that further improvements will be hard to come by, particularly if GDP growth remains moderate and close to trend. We’re dropping the concern about trying to match it up to the Humphrey–Hawkins testimonies, and that has the advantage of more regular meetings, but also, in particular, the four SEPs and four press conferences will be strictly quarterly, and I think that’s advantageous.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It was noted that consumption spending has held up despite weak income growth, and lower gasoline prices will help there. There is at least one complication in the outlook, which is that extended unemployment benefits are now actually very actively disappearing. Moreover, we have a downward trend in labor force participation that is going to make the assessment of labor market conditions more difficult and will, at the same time, slow the gains in income that otherwise would occur. As I’ve talked about in years past, when the economy is growing very slowly, the internal dynamics regard, I note that real disposable personal income rose only 0.4 percent during 2011, was revised significantly downward in Q4, and is currently shown as growing at an annual rate of only about a ½ percent in Q1. With economic growth slowing, with unemployment not improving, and with inflation risk declining, it would be quite a straightforward call for us to ease further at this point. So on the balance sheet side, I’d point to four issues that I’m sure we’ll hear                                                            a lot more about also in the policy go-round—capital loss risk, risks about exit, financial stability risks, and market functioning risks. Just to summarize, the outlook has gotten worse, the risks are more severe, and we have a forecast that, frankly, is very hard to defend—one in which unemployment is above everybody’s estimate of the long-run natural rate and is coming down very slowly at the same time that inflation is less than our target.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " So what we have here is a projection that is a little bit more optimistic on economic growth and unemployment than the Tealbook, with slightly higher inflation numbers. On the other hand, one participant noted that the slowdown is reminiscent of what happened this time last year and that factors such as the strength in autos, the housing recovery, and a possible reduction in uncertainty could lead to stronger growth. Prices are up, though artificially low inventories in cities with lots of negative equity may explain part of the rise. Of course, the problem is that 2 percent growth is just simply not enough to give us significant improvement in the labor market or to provide protection against adverse shocks, and the recovery continues to be, I think, in somewhat fragile condition. Indeed, arguably, durables purchases are increasing more strongly than might be expected, which I take to be at least a little bit inconsistent with the view that pervasive uncertainty is the dominant factor. And now the argument seems to go the other way; people are claiming that there must be a very strong relationship— which would imply that inflation should be falling now—or, alternatively, that if we were to be more expansionary, we would get an inflation problem. The one observation I would make is that if you do believe that 8 percent unemployment is far from the sustainable level, and that inflation is close to target, the usual objective function would suggest that the marginal cost of more unemployment is much higher than the marginal cost of more inflation, and that should enter into your thinking as you make that calculation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Sales are up, permits and prices are also rising, inventories are low, and delinquencies are falling. Discussion of the structure of the labor market noted that routine jobs are disappearing, but declining dynamism may be more chronic than cyclical, and the long-term unemployed are not completely shut out of the labor Uncertainty remains an important issue for businesses, holding back investment and hiring. There was a good bit of premature discussion of monetary policy, which covered, among other things, the effectiveness of possible actions, the risks and benefits of actions and inaction, and issues of communication. The basic outlook is, as everyone has pointed out, that we have an economy that is growing very slowly, at or below trend, and, by the usual Okun’s law relationships, we’re not seeing very much progress in the labor market. I want to emphasize that on all of these things—on the economy, on the effects of policy—we’re incredibly uncertain, and we have to make decisions under                                                     uncertainty. And I believe we all have to try to think hard about, in a Bayesian context, using information that we have and thinking about both the risks of action and the risks of inaction, what the best choices are, acknowledging and understanding that whatever we do, it’s going to be a shot in the proverbial dark. The evidence is that while we are not necessarily facing recession or crisis, it’s also true that we seem to have stalled, and that very serious problems with unemployment are not improving.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Given the slow pace of growth, unemployment should decline only gradually. Some improvement has been seen in the labor market, including more hours and lower unemployment. Herd liquidations are keeping meat prices down; high tech anticipates gains. We talked about a possible positive dynamic where rising house prices both increase demand and improve creditworthiness and the willingness of banks to lend. If we think of this as the public learning at the same time that their potential output was lower and it’s                                                   going to be lower, then total output comes down because potential output is down, but slack is unchanged because aggregate demand comes down by the same amount. What you could interpret this as saying is that the financial crisis may have disrupted to some extent the TFP growth through capital allocation, through capital deepening, through entrepreneurial activities, et cetera, and that slowed down potential output growth. But, at the same time, the slow growth, the slow recovery, the shock of the crisis, all of those things have also made businesses and                                                                                                                 households pessimistic about the future and depressed aggregate demand and, therefore, created an output gap reflected in the unemployment rate. One is that as the financial crisis wears off, so to speak, we should see perhaps somewhat more normal output growth or TFP growth. We could say, for example, “Conditions in the housing sector have continued to improve, albeit from a depressed level.”  That’s a little stronger than saying “further signs of improvement,” or I’m willing to go all the way to what you suggested.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The loss of UI benefits may be one reason for lower unemployment, as people are leaving the labor force. Some contacts expressed worries about low interest rates, one of those worries being increased contributions to defined benefit pensions. First, while it is true that unemployment has come down quite a bit, I think that the unemployment rate probably understates how weak labor markets are. In particular, to the extent that credit availability is improving, for example, and to the extent that higher house prices make mortgage credit more available, monetary policy might become more effective. A final observation is that I think we are actually kind of hedged on this issue in the following sense:  The scenarios in which interest rates rise and we have capital losses are also most likely the scenarios in which the economy is doing better and, therefore, interest rates are rising. Second, I say that as we consider unemployment in this condition, we’ll want to comfort ourselves that the decline in unemployment is associated with higher payrolls, hours, et cetera, as opposed to a weakening of the labor market—withdrawal, participation declines, and so on. For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will take into account the extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers and falling labor force participation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The outlook today was variously characterized as gaining a little traction, modest gains, trend-like growth, improving prospects, and possible upside surprise, among others. The risks are less skewed to the downside, particularly risks associated with Europe and China; Japan is more of a question. Potential growth likely fell in the aftermath of the crisis, perhaps causing unemployment to fall more quickly but also keeping growth at disappointingly low levels. The labor market is generally improving, and unemployment is likely to gradually more quickly, and UI claims are low. The better tone in financial markets and the generally improved outlook reflect probably two things:  both a better modal outlook and reduced risk, downside risk in particular. For example, in Europe, while there’s been progress in developing a single bank supervisor in the euro area, there’s been some backsliding in terms of requiring countries to recapitalize their own banks in the case of losses, which tends to increase the so-called doom loop between weak countries and weak banks. But it’s been argued by some authors that because of the weakness of the economy, the incentive to put those innovations to work in the market on a the scale necessary to make those innovations profitable was not there, and so it was only after the Depression, World War II, and subsequently that those innovations contributed to a boom in productivity.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " If you’d like to know more about the investigation, if you have specific questions or concerns, please feel free to talk to Bill or Scott. However, some saw unemployment as declining only     slowly going forward because growth is not sufficient to maintain this pace. A particular challenge for contemporary monetary policy is calibrating the risks of crisis and the effects of crisis on our macroeconomic objectives. If you look at indexes of financial conditions or indexes of financial stress, which four or five Reserve Banks around the table put out, most of them show that financial conditions have eased fairly significantly since last summer and are now more easy than normal, relative to a long-run benchmark. And as far as transitions are concerned, I agree with points made around the table that hiring and quit data are going to be a little bit difficult to interpret, but nevertheless we are seeing some improvements in the transitions between unemployment and employment—rising slowly, still below the long-run trends, but showing some improvement. In fact, you see more industries have negative growth in average hourly earnings than have average hourly earnings growth greater than 4 percent. I will make the logical point that a slowing of purchases is a slowing in the pace at which accommodation is added, as opposed to a tightening, and that the tightening process, whenever that comes in the future, will take place via the rate process—and I’ll mention the projections that say 2015.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The risks to the economic growth outlook still appear to be to the downside, but there’s some disagreement on whether those risks have lessened recently. In the household sector, households are exhibiting “subdued enthusiasm.”  Wealth is up and leverage is down, both helping consumption, but perceived income volatility is also up. The benefits of these easier financial conditions are most obvious in interest-and credit-sensitive sectors like consumer durables and housing, but I think the explanation for why consumption seems stronger than income would justify is that wealth, easier financial conditions, lower interest rates, and so on are supporting consumers and allowing them to save less out of their current disposable income. Going forward, as supply conditions—that is, availability of homes—continue to improve, and as demand improves but more slowly, I would suspect that we’ll see less increase in house prices but more activity, and activity will be important for related industries and for employment. On the other hand, there is an argument, which was in the same Erceg and Levin paper I mentioned earlier, that the explanation for the very weak wage growth is this broader employment gap and not just the unemployment gap—the fact that there are people just on the other side of labor force participation who would like to have jobs. I do think that the very low numbers we’ve been getting, which are the lowest we’ve seen, basically, since the crisis, are at least partly artificial, and we will see some increase.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The idea is to present the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section in a more concise bullet-like form that would be, we hope, better structured and more usable by readers and would spare the R&S staff many, many late hours trying to figure out exactly the right adjective in their prose. And then the other question I have is that it sounded like from your discussion of natural gas versus oil that one could almost make the case, or at least it’s a possibility, that the trade barriers would be welfare-improving if there were enough externalities of lower natural gas prices. They have deleveraged more,    and they are withstanding pretty well the tax increases, and weak wage gains, and weak disposable personal income growth that they have been experiencing thus far. Notwithstanding the higher mortgage rates, it still seems to be relatively strong, although higher mortgage rates are potentially a risk for both housing and autos and other consumer durables. We do have to continue to monitor possibly excessive risk-taking and asset price distortions, even though the higher rates and greater volatility may have reduced some of that incentive. There was a good bit of premature policy commentary, which I shouldn’t reward [laughter], but one general theme that came out a lot was about policy uncertainty. First of all, the markets are obviously very much on edge, and we risk both higher rates and much more volatility if we are not clearer.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Others note that the possible growth pickup may be threatened by higher interest rates, higher oil prices, fiscal uncertainty, and other factors. The SLOOS was positive, demand for small business loans is up, and in general banks continue to see improved conditions with purchase applications for mortgages having held up, even though refi demand has dropped sharply. With respect to more general observations, rate guidance might benefit from a lower bound on projected inflation as the condition for a rate increase. But I think this is a question we need to address seriously, because there was some concern about whether we were taking the low inflation sufficiently seriously. To make my suggestion concrete, we have this current statement:  “The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor risks of persistent low inflation have increased somewhat”—something like that. The suggestion I made was to add to the risks statement “but the risks of persistent low inflation have increased somewhat.”  We have to find some way    to signal concern. First, on the three questions, with the exception of President Bullard, who was concerned, understandably, about making the guidance if not actually noncontingent, at least apparently noncontingent, the great majority of the Committee is at least broadly comfortable with the asset purchase plan that has been laid out; so that’s a good thing for us to clarify.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Payroll growth recently has been somewhat disappointing, and the employment-to-population ratio—at least for the entire population, as opposed to the working-age population—has been pretty stagnant. If you look at other unemployment measures—the broader ones, including marginally attached workers or involuntary part-time workers, et cetera—they have come down as much or more as the standard unemployment measure. And so, I think a central part of the argument is that there has been some tightening, but even though the amount of tightening is uncertain, one thing we don’t know for sure is whether the economy can continue to move forward or whether this is going to be something that is going to damage the recovery going forward. If we were to taper tomorrow, and the data got worse, then we would not really be much better off because we would have to delay further reductions until we saw more indications of a better outlook. Just looking at the language here, first in paragraph 3 of alternative B, the beginning of that, we say we take note of “the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program,” which is “consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.” That strikes me as a pretty upbeat description, a basic outlook that is for a pickup of growth as fiscal drag is reduced and continuing improvement in labor market conditions.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Putting those two things together suggests that the persistent effects of the financial crisis and the recession on confidence, uncertainty, credit availability—all of those factors—seems to account for about ½ percentage point of the 2 percentage points by which the funds rate in 2016 is below the longer-run normal level. And I think it’s fair to say that, while reduced restraint on the fiscal side should provide some benefit—and we’ll get even more benefit if the current negotiations, through some miracle, end up loosening the effects of the sequestration a bit in exchange, for example, for some longer-term cuts—a good bit of the projected increase in economic growth in 2014 still does depend on consumers behaving more as they have in the past, given their wealth, income, and other factors. Now, I think a very important general point that President Kocherlakota, Governor Tarullo, and a number of other people made, was that if we’re going to rationalize slowing asset purchases at a point before the substantial improvement criteria are met, we need to begin to talk more about the efficacy and costs, and I would say particularly the costs because efficacy, at least to a signaling channel, was pretty clear. But given the sense of the Committee, I guess I propose that we cut out all the red in B(1)and start the first sentence of B(1) with “information received.”     We’ll cut down through “however.”  I have no objection to eliminating “in response to higher mortgage rates” and just simply saying, “While the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months.”  Is there any concern about that?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " One is that participation is falling, and if it is the fact that those people who are most likely to retire or to otherwise leave the labor force are those who are either unemployed or have a high propensity to be unemployed, that’s going to tend to lower the natural rate—not for good                                                            reasons, but, nevertheless, it does lower the average unemployment rate of people still looking for work. The other reason—which is more positive, and which was explained in the staff’s June 2013 memo on why they lowered their estimate of the natural rate—is that their concerns about structural damage to the labor market and increased skill mismatch have been reduced, basically simply for the reason that what we’ve seen is unemployment coming down much more quickly than expected, with no signs of inflation in either prices or wages. So, again, despite the fact that unemployment is a good indicator of the labor market, and despite the fact that it has come down a lot more than expected, the optimal control simulation pushes out the date for raising rates because inflation is lower and because there appears to be more scope to push unemployment down, given the fact that it has come down so quickly without inflation. In a speech about a month ago, I actually said something like, “The unemployment rate is the best single indicator                                                   that we have, and that’s why we’re using it to essentially trigger the broader conversation about what’s happening in the labor market.”  So, assuming we do not lower the threshold, if I’m asked why we didn’t lower the threshold, my plan is to say something like, “Well, again, the unemployment rate is the best single indicator.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although considerable uncertainty remains, risks appear more balanced with respect to economic growth and employment. On the one hand, declines in participation and increases in underemployment and long-term unemployment suggest that labor slack is greater than the unemployment rate indicates. Some transitory factors, including low growth in import prices and low rates of health-care inflation, are playing some role in holding inflation down. On the policy front, upcoming possible challenges include managing the forward guidance as the economy strengthens and we pass through the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold, as well as dealing with possible increases in term premiums or bubbles in asset prices even as unemployment remains high and inflation low. With the saving rate high and interest rates low, that does suggest, on the one hand, that there is some potential for consumption to grow more quickly than income for a while, which would, obviously, be supportive of aggregate demand. So, roughly speaking, an implication of                                                             this Tealbook box story is that in the past seven years, somewhere between 2½ and 5 percent of the labor force has become structurally unemployed, which, if true, is a tragedy, of course, as we have lost a huge amount of labor resources. If you look at alternative B, we would change the risk balance from “sees the risks as having become more nearly balanced” to “sees the risks as nearly                                                         balanced.”  The fact is, that is a change, and it’s actually going in the direction of slightly less risk.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Real growth is slowing, but I do think there remainsenough momentum to keep aggregate demand growing at a rate somewhat inexcess of the growth rate of potential output long enough to push theeconomy above potential in the absence of some further monetaryrestraint. Most important in my thinking,the decline in the value of the dollar and upward revisions inestimates concerning the strength of foreign economies will bereducing the drag on demand that stems from net exports. The strength of neworders for durable goods and the strong profit projections suggestcontinuing strength in investment, and the staff analysis convinces methat there are risks that the slowdown in demand could beinsufficient, absent some further tightening to prevent overheating.With respect to the issue of how close the economy is topotential, I confess uncertainty here. I don'tyet see strong enough indications of tightness in labor markets, orenough signs of increasing wage pressure, or sufficient indication ofa pickup in the growth of unit labor costs to conclude that we haveventured beyond potential. Capacity utilization is high by historicalstandards, but investment also is adding to capacity at a rapid rate.I see only scattered evidence of lengthening lags in filling orders.On balance, I'd say my sense is that the economy could stay where itis in terms of unemployment or even shave a few tenths more off theunemployment rate without risking significantly a pickup in inflation.This inclines me toward the feeling that there should be sometightening of policy to reduce momentum, but somewhat less than theGreenbook assumes.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I agree with the central message of theGreenbook that most of the new information that has accumulated duringthe last six weeks points to continued strength in aggregate demand.-29-9/27/94The incoming data do not yet provide any significant evidence of asufficient slowdown in real GDP growth. I think not, but the Greenbook thinks thatit will require a period of unemployment in excess of the natural ratein the latter half of 1995 and 1996 to subdue inflation, and that'ssomething more than a quibble because it does govern one's view abouthow much additional restraint it is going to take to hold inflation atits present level.To elaborate just a bit, I think we are witnessing now aperfectly normal cyclical phenomenon, namely, the relative prices ofprimary commodities and raw materials tend naturally to increase withthe level of domestic and more importantly world economic activity.The prices of these materials have been increasing rapidly all year,but from initially depressed levels. Historically, Ithink the evidence on the likely pass-through of temporary priceshocks into wages is quite inconclusive.The only caveat I want to add in this analysis is that I'massuming along with the Greenbook that the unemployment rate is notgoing to be allowed to fall below the natural rate--and that means notvery much lower than it currently is--for any significant period oftime. With respect to the question of whether or not we are below thenatural rate, I think wage behavior provides the best direct evidence.The fact that wages have been so well-behaved, with average hourlyearnings rising only 0.2 percent last month, for example, convinces methat we have not overshot the natural rate.I support your proposal, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The recent decline in the dollar exacerbates thisconcern, although fortunately the dollar has risen a bit against boththe mark and the yen since the Greenbook was put to bed. It is not surprising that we are seeing someearly warning signs of rising inflation, including business reportsthat there will be price increases after the first of the year andanecdotes about rising wages to retain and attract qualifiedemployees. I think there is riskhere unless aggregate demand is restrained.Now, what concerns me most in connection with the Greenbookforecast is that the assumed further tightening of 150 basis pointsentails considerable downside risk to the economy that will beconcentrated in 1996. I conclude that the degree of tightening assumedin the Greenbook poses a serious risk of a hard landing in 1996,although in the absence of some further tightening, I think therewould be an unacceptable risk that inflation would accelerate.As I mentioned, it seems clear to me that sometightening of policy is needed to prevent inflation from accelerating,but I have strong doubts about the need for an additional 150 basis-40-11/15/94points. As Don mentioned, it worries me that in the absence of anannouncement of the type we issued in August, 75 can backfire.Instead of simply flattening the yield curve and our seeing verylittle effect on long-term rates, a rise of this magnitude may raiseso concerned about it--and market expectations about the ultimateexpected tightening that we intend here. I am concerned about thepossibility that bond yields could rise more than the Greenbookforecast, which could provoke a stock market reaction.\n",

Nevertheless, I'll justcontinue to emphasize, as others and I have in the past, that ourprevious actions have added a great deal of restraint to the pipeline.Since our last meeting real interest rates have risen considerably,and as Bill McDonough emphasized, real interest rates by variousmeasures are not low by historical standards. I share the concern of a number of privateforecasters and of some of you that this degree of tightening in thenear term could slow demand growth and that we could end up producinga boom/bust scenario. To avoid such an outcome, it seems to me thatthe funds rate would have to fall rather quickly, by more than theGreenbook assumes, once growth slows to trend, even with the economybelow the NAIRU.Mr. Ithink a wait-and-see strategy is reasonable, given the magnitude ofprevious tightening and particularly given our uncertainty aboutwhether and how much the economy is likely to slow on its own and myown uncertainty about how much additional tightening is going to beneeded.\n",

      " Each percentage point reduction in inflation costson the order of 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, which is about$300 billion, and entails about 2.2 percentage-point-years ofunemployment in excess of the natural rate.If we testify, it seems to me that we should point out thatthe benefits of price stability are elusive and that the costs ofadditional output instability with such a plan could easily outweighthe benefits of greater inflation stability. Becauseuncertainty about sales impedes business planning and could harmcapital formation just as much as uncertainty about inflation cancreate uncertainty about relative prices and harm business planning.I noticed that the Neal resolution contained a preamble, and it readin part, \"whereas zero inflation promotes the highest possiblesustainable level of employment, the maximum sustainable rate ofeconomic growth, and the highest possible rate of savings and-44-1/31-2/1/95investment...\" I found it interesting to contrast this with theconclusion of the Federal Reserve System's price stability andeconomic performance project in 1989 that read, \"We have investigatedboth direct and indirect evidence surrounding the hypothesis thatinflation adversely affects the performance of the real economy. We now seeautomobile companies offering rebates on popular models, loweringproduction plans, and shutting down assembly lines for some periods.Dealer orders for inventories appear to have declined, maybe becausethe cost of carrying them is higher now, but maybe also becausetraffic through showrooms has declined. On the international front,as Governor Blinder pointed out, we have risks of declines in ourexports to two of our most important trading partners, Mexico andCanada, with the possibility that if the Mexican crisis harms otheremerging markets, our exports can suffer there too.\n",

      " The data that we reviewed at our last meetingprovided inconclusive and, as we put it, tentative signs of slowing ingrowth. The magnitude of any moderation in demand growth seemeduncertain and the timing of the long awaited slowdown was also inquestion. I would say the evidence in hand now points to aslowdown that is somewhat greater and more pervasive than previouslyanticipated. The incoming data coupled, of course, with our recentrate hike have led to downward revisions in the projected growth invirtually every component of demand. From my standpoint, what we are finallyseeing is the result of previous Fed tightening emerging through thepipeline, with the interest-sensitive sectors, housing and autos,leading the way exactly as theory and past experience predict. On thedown side, we are now seeing a significant inventory buildup inautomobiles leading to production cuts in the spring, and thatsignificantly weakens the forecast in the near term. Investmentgrowth also looks like it is slowing, not excessively but neverthelessslowing. Most important, of course,what we are seeing is, to my mind, surprising and continued moderationin compensation growth and subdued growth in unit labor costs. Ifwages continue to be, as Ed Boehne put it, a nonproblem, that suggeststhat eventually we may have reason to question whether that the NAIRUis 6 percent or .1 or so lower. There are all kinds of uncertainties in the outlook.Indeed, we may have a false negative; we may be learning that.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As I evaluate the most recent set of economicdata, I remain quite optimistic that we will achieve the soft landingprojected in the Greenbook, with growth slowing below trend during1995 and rising back toward trend in 1996, and with inflationremaining contained during the process. Fourth,we now have clear evidence of a significant slowdown under way, butthere is little evidence of any inventory overhang outside theautomobile and housing sectors, and I think that limits thepossibility of a hard landing.One of the favorable factors affecting the outlook is that,in the words of the Greenbook, \"labor costs remain under remarkablerestraint.\" Now, it seems natural toexpect the personal saving rate as measured in the national income andproduct accounts, which include expenditures on durables, to rise whenspending on durables is weak and to fall when spending on durables isstrong simply because durable goods provide a flow of services over along time horizon and are thus a form of savings from the households'perspective. Myconcern is that that assumption may be too optimistic, and sinceconsumption is such a large fraction of total expenditures, an errorhere can have significant repercussions for the forecast.-27-5/23/95A second downside risk comes from the potential spillovereffects of the inventory adjustment currently under way in theautomobile sector, which is forecast to depress real GDP growth in thecurrent and subsequent quarters. I don't want to quarrel with theGreenbook analysis here; it is just that I always worry that there isa possibility of significant repercussions through the multiplier ifhouseholds cut consumption in response to a decline in income andthrough the accelerator process if investment slows down in responseto a decline in the growth rate of real GDP, especially at a time whencapacity constraints are easing.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Governor Lindsey voicedconcern at our last meeting that credit terms may stop easing or mayeven tighten during a process of slow growth or conceivably recessionif default rates, which are now showing some hints of picking up, wereto rise further.Another risk concerns consumption, which has been sluggishthis quarter and could easily rebound less strongly toward year-endthan the Greenbook assumes, particularly if a backup in long ratesputs downward pressure on the stock market. Itcomes through one country spending less and other countries seeingtheir exports fall and their growth prospects disappointed.And then, of course, there is fiscal policy where since ourlast meeting I think the prospects for a contractionary fiscal packagehave improved considerably.Now, to offset those sources of weakness, the Greenbookforecast relies on a strong rebound in housing demand and associatedspending on furniture and other durables, including motor vehicles.But under the baseline fed funds assumption with some backup of longrates, I see a real risk of insufficient revival in these sectors.Moreover, as the Bluebook baseline simulation makes apparent, and MikePrell reiterated this, by 1996 the tighter fiscal scenario aloneclearly points to reduction in the natural, equilibrium, or whateveryou want to call it, Wicksellian real rate of interest consistent withan economy operating at potential. Onthe inflation side, I think a funds rate cut is consistent with ourlonger-term objective of gradually attaining price stability, giventhe greater slack already in evidence in both product and laborfunds rate of the size we are envisioning here, show a decline ininflationary pressures as we go forward.To me, one of the major rationales for such a cut, asGovernor Blinder and others have emphasized, is that we need to cementin place the existing financial conditions that are already working toprovide the critical cushion against the downside risks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " While I, too, would like tofind a reason to disagree with the Greenbook, I find myself insubstantial agreement with the Greenbook's assessment of the data.Most important to my way of thinking is that we now have mountingevidence that the inventory adjustment under way is proceeding morerapidly and with substantially less disruption of growth in finalsales than I had been fearing. The continued strength of consumptionand investment spending in the face of the inventory adjustment,coupled with strong evidence of a rebound in residential construction,substantially mitigates what I had thought was one of the most seriousdownside risks. I think that those twoforces are working to restrain this upside risk.At our last meeting, Mr. Chairman, you argued that thepresent level of the real funds rate is above the neutral orequilibrium level that is needed for stable growth with a continuingsecular downtrend in the rate of inflation. I agree with Governor Blinder'sexplanation that if we were to go beyond the six quarters in theGreenbook, we would see initially a mild shortfall in growth belowwhat is needed to keep the economy operating at potential and then thegap would begin to widen. And as David Stockton emphasized,the continued moderation in the growth of benefit costs andcompensation is a favorable factor in the inflation outlook. It maybe too soon to break out the champagne, but it seems quite likely tome that we will succeed in capping the inflation rate in this cycleand preserving the gains that have been made on the inflation front inthe 1991 recession and the ensuing recovery.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although the odds of a train wreck remain low,a default on the government debt could touch off financialrepercussions that would greatly upset Greenbook types of projections.But, of course, on that score we will just have to wait and see whathappens.The longer-term problem that confronts us at this stage,though, is gauging whether the federal funds rate remains above thelevel that is needed to achieve trend growth further out in theforecast period, and I mean in late 1996 and 1997 and beyond. What I think the Greenbook projectionssuggest is that the real funds rate is a little too high to supporttrend growth with the assumed degree of budget contraction, and it mayturn out that the budget contraction will be greater; we will see.In this sense I think we have what Charles Schultz dubbed a\"termites in the basement\" problem, although he was using that phraseto talk about the federal deficits of years ago. Termitesnibble away slowly so the problem just creeps up and there is no greatsense of urgency that one absolutely has to deal with it on one day asopposed to the next. I like the idea that we should be asked to defineprice stability and report to Congress on how we intend to achieve it.I like the bill's recognition of the fact that the attainment of pricestability is not costless in terms of transitional losses in outputand employment, and I like the fact that it explicitly directs us totake these losses into account in the transition period.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The staff's view is that the newspoints to significantly greater underlying strength in aggregatedemand and a modest reduction in inflation risk. I think the staff procedure for generating the currentforecast is easily defended on statistical grounds because surprisesin demand do appear to have persistence. These would include--andall of these have been mentioned--anecdotal reports from industrycontacts, yesterday's weak retail sales reading, sluggish auto demand,evidence of rising consumer debt problems that Governors Lindsey andKelley have emphasized, today's IP number, softness in the purchasingmanagers' survey, a rising moving average of initial claims forunemployment insurance, and signs of softer growth in Europeaneconomies. Rather than quibble with the details of thestaff's point forecast, I would prefer to reserve judgment for a whileand await further clarification from incoming data, assuming that thegovernment shutdown doesn't actually end up eliminating the continuingdata flow.On the inflation front the news since our last meeting, itseems to me, has been on balance favorable. But most important, as a number of you haveemphasized, is that total hourly compensation grew at a mere 2.3percent in the third quarter, and I guess it is that continuingrestraint in the employment cost index that justifies the downwardrevision of the NAIRU and the improvement in the inflation forecast.I think the revisions in the staff's natural rate assumption and inaggregate demand reflect a response to data surprises that we don'tfully understand. It is a biastoward below trend growth the further out one goes in the forecast.It stems from insufficient momentum in private spending to compensatefor growing fiscal drag and the real federal funds rate remaining atits current level.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " After a period of near-trend growth in 1996, he foresees a biastoward below-trend growth thereafter with rising unemployment,assuming that the real federal funds rate is kept at its currentlevel. Similarly, our own MPS model contains such a bias towardbelow-trend growth under the Greenbook fed funds assumption, althoughit does project an even stronger 1996 than the Greenbook due to thelagged but temporary influence of wealth effects from the stockI thought I might enumerate some of my reasons for expectingthis bias toward below-trend growth, and I will just quickly mentionseven factors that are operative in my view. Now, we can dispute whether and how muchstock prices matter to consumption, but if higher stock prices arecontributing and will continue to contribute in 1996 to strongconsumption growth, eventually this influence is going to subside. Fourth, pent-up demand for consumer durablesis presumably spent, and it seems to me that rising delinquencies onconsumer debt coupled with higher debt service ratios suggest at aminimum less robust consumption growth going forward. Inparticular, a 10 percent correction of the stock market would add ahalf percentage point to the unemployment rate after 6 to 8 quarters.So, clearly, the view that policy is restrictive at this stageinvolves a difficult and tricky judgment call. On thefiscal policy linkage issue, it seems to me that acting today ratherthan waiting for a budget deal to be completed will enable us tomitigate at least to some extent the unfortunate public perception ofa Fed that plays budget politics by holding out rewards andpunishments related to progress on the negotiations.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The progress of theeconomy over the last several months has been reminiscent of \"theperils of Pauline,\" with blizzards, government shutdowns, threats ofdefault on the national debt, strikes, and a frightening albeit briefdive in the stock market threatening the progress of our heroine.Nevertheless, the single most probable outcome at this stage is thatthis economy will survive its treacherous adventure and ultimatelyattain trend growth with stable inflation. Meanwhile, demand has held up surprisingly well inthe face of a rather large inventory adjustment in the fourth quarter.Over the longer term, a projection of near-trend growththrough 1997 with roughly stable inflation strikes me as a plausiblescenario, although there are some risks. On the negative side, I amparticularly concerned at this stage about the possibility of asignificant stock market correction. The current level of stockprices is not impossible, but it is increasingly difficult to justifyin terms of fundamentals. I am also concerned about the likely negative,albeit lagged, impact on housing and consumer durable spending of thevery substantial increases in interest rates since our last meeting.I find the longer-term Greenbook projection of housing startsparticularly optimistic in light of these increases. On balance, withintermediate- and long-term interest rates at their current levels, Ifeel less certain than the staff that trend growth is possible as wego out in the forecast period. While recent readings on average hourly earningsprovide reassurance that wages are not accelerating, the jump inhealth insurance costs evident in the fourth-quarter employment costindex creates the worrisome prospect that these benefit cost increasesone single report, but I do agree with the Greenbook's assessment thatthis is one of the risks going forward.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As I outlined my thoughts on the nationaleconomy in preparation for today's meeting, I realized that I amrunning the risk of sounding like a broken record by reiteratingthemes that are completely familiar, given the remarks I have beenmaking during the last several meetings. With the governmentshutdown and the blizzard, interpretations of the statistics for thefourth quarter of 1995 and the current quarter are obviously quiteconfusing, but my sense on balance is that growth has weakened a bitand I am becoming--to use the same word that Ed Boehne used--a bitmore jittery and marginally more pessimistic about the short-termoutlook. I certainly am not envisioning an economy that isheading for an imminent recession, but I think a growth recession withgradually rising unemployment is a distinct risk if we keep the fundsrate where it is now. Yes,velocity is very uncertain, but at a minimum we ought to have rangesthat encompass the staff's best guess about what monetary growth weare going to end up with under the preferred policy strategy. But as we get to lower rates of inflation,we need to think much more carefully about the costs and benefits ofmoving to still lower rates. There also maybe a further permanent loss that occurs because a little inflation,particularly in an economy with slow productivity growth, greases thewheels and makes relative wage adjustments easier and may facilitateintersectoral allocations of labor. The alternative simulations presented in the Greenbookcertainly caution us that we would be running a very significantinflation risk if we were to adopt the easier alternative and cut thefunds rate by a cumulative 100 basis points.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In my assessment of the outlook, the risk ofsustained demand growth exceeding the growth of potential is notabsent. With theinventory adjustment process seemingly nearing completion, at least bythe end of this quarter, I find it hard to identify any fundamentalfactor or imbalance--other than the dangerously lofty level of stockprices--that I consider likely to spur either unsustainably rapidgrowth or alternatively to pose a significant risk of recession. We should be concerned if apattern of faster wage and salary growth materializes, if thattranslates into faster compensation growth, and if in turn the fastercompensation growth translates into more rapid core inflation. Assuming that both firmsand workers recognize the tradeoff they face between benefits andtake-home pay, slower benefits growth should be reflected in fasterwage and salary growth. I am simply urging caution andam warning against automatically assuming that the growth in these twocomponents of compensation is unconnected and that they lead their ownlives.My final \"if\" concerned the relationship between fastercompensation growth and product price inflation and whether we shouldautomatically assume that the translation there will be one-for-one.The counter argument is that for the last several years product priceincreases have outstripped increases in unit labor costs and that hasresulted in widening markups, unusually strong earnings growth, and arise in the profit share. That-23-5/21/96could occur in a number of ways: with a decline in the inflation ratecoupled with stable compensation growth or with an increase in thepace of compensation growth and stable inflation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Even withnominal short-term rates at .5 percent, real short-term rates cannotfall into the needed negative territory.Second, and to my mind the most important argument for somelow inflation rate, is the \"greasing-the-wheels argument\" on thegrounds that a little inflation lowers unemployment by facilitatingadjustments in relative pay in a world where individuals deeplydislike nominal pay cuts. Even so, these authors find thatthe needed frequency of nominal cuts rises rapidly as inflationwages after two years of losses, an additional 5 percent of firmswould seek to cut wages at 3 percent inflation, 10 percent at 2percent inflation, 19 percent at 1 percent inflation, and 33 percentof firms would ideally impose wage cuts on workers at zero measuredinflation.Productivity growth is placed at the current1 percent level. If we go back to the 1950s and 1960s and ask why we had lowunemployment with low inflation, I think the answer is thatproductivity growth was much more rapid and that makes a bigdifference.The key question is how much permanent unemployment rises asinflation falls, and here the methodology used to assess theconsequences does matter. But even so, I think it is apparent that an economywhere 20 to 30 percent of firms need to impose pay cuts in a typicalyear to operate efficiently is likely to be an economy that will endup functioning below its potential.The simulations in this paper assume that, except incircumstances where the firm is really in trouble, workers resist andfirms are unwilling to impose nominal pay cuts for fear of harmingworker morale and causing productivity-reducing backlash.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Market participants could easily be disappointed,particularly if productivity performance is disappointing and wagepressures intensify, thereby setting the stage for a very significantcorrection.With respect to the inflation outlook, my opinion is littlechanged from last time. At the same time, growth in benefit costsremains well contained, at least thus far, and I also found the ViceChairman's comments about the prospects here a hopeful sign. In spite of this uptick, though, nominal compensationgrowth still remains well below the pace that historical econometricrelations would be predicting, and the uptick may thus simply reflecta rebound toward a more normal level. I also think Don Kohnhas properly warned us that if we are actually below NAIRU and fail toact, all we will end up doing is buying more output and more jobs nowat the expense of less output and fewer jobs later, in effect addingto cyclical fluctuations rather than mitigating them. In situations where forecast uncertainly is extremelyhigh, I, at least, find it appealing to look for some guidance fromthe recommendations of sensible feedback rules, so I would simplyreiterate what Don Kohn pointed out, which is that the funds ratejudged by Taylor's Rule or other simple benchmarks is now at quite areasonable level given current levels of unemployment and inflation.On the other hand, the rule definitely calls for a policy adjustment-44-8/20/96if either of two things occurs: first, if the degree of labor marketslack declines appreciably, presumably because demand fails to slow aswe anticipate; or second, if broad inflation measures rise.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " On balance, itseems likely that demand growth will revert toward trend in comingquarters, with the risks to that forecast roughly balanced.The primary problem that confronts us is that labor marketsare already tight, and during the assumed transition to trend growthslack is likely to diminish even further. Although there isupward pressure on entry-level wages, more senior workers andparticularly those who have earned wage premia in the past, whether itis due to the power of their unions or the generous compensationpolicies of their employers, seem to be struggling to defend theirjobs and to avoid sacrificing the perks they currently enjoy. And, of course, while wage growth has accelerated,compensation growth has increased only moderately because companieshave offset more rapid wage increases with greater health care costcontainment. We may hypothesize that that favorable trend is about toconclude, but anecdotal reports suggest that corporations remainconfident of their ability to achieve further cost savings.In contrast to past expansions that have led to inflationaryupticks, capacity utilization is not excessively strained. I also agree that withdemand moderating and current inflation stable or falling, we may endup deciding that it is unnecessary to move the funds rate upward.But having said that, I believe that a very solid case canalso be made for raising the federal funds rate at least modestly, by25 basis points, on the grounds that the unemployment rate has notcheddown further, the decline in labor market slack is palpable, and theodds of a rise in the inflation rate have increased, whatever thelevel of the NAIRU and the associated level of those odds. In my mind, what goes upcan also come down, and we risk an error if we make the hurdle formoving our policy instrument too high.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Economic performance with respect to both job creation andinflation has been excellent, and developments during the intermeetingperiod have enhanced the prospect that these favorable trends willpersist. Additional good news from an inflation perspective is thatprices of commodities and intermediate goods have turned down sinceour last meeting. The outlook for food prices has improved, and eventhe outlook for energy prices is more favorable. In particular, I was struck by arecent Business Week article that detailed myriad ways in which thewith unskilled, disadvantaged workers to inculcate good work habitsand in particular to teach English as a second language to improvebasic literacy and create opportunities for eventual promotions intomore responsible positions. Although I believe there is strongevidence that NAIRU has declined below 6 percent, it seems difficultto use the data in hand at this point to defend the proposition thatit is as low as 5.2 percent.My second worry relates to the behavior of aggregate demand.Here I have no quarrel with the staff's estimate of moderation ingrowth to a shade above trend in 1997 and 1998, but I am concernedabout the risks. As Mike noted, consumers have greater income andwealth and their confidence is high, so it is perfectly reasonable toassume that the third-quarter spending lull was temporary and astatistical aberration. Indeed, I think one could easily justify amuch stronger consumption forecast than in the Greenbook, given theenormous gains in stock market wealth and the huge increase inhousehold net worth that we have seen in spite of the buildup inconsumer debt. I would consider it perfectly possiblefor demand to end up moderating more than the Greenbook assumes,eliminating the excess pressure in the labor market and any need foradditional monetary tightening.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Thelimited new data that are available since our last meeting support thestaff's prediction that the lull in consumer spending over the summerwas likely a temporary aberration and not the onset of any period ofsignificant retrenchment due to tightening consumer credit orescalating debt burdens. Indeed, I have been fighting the crowds andsearching in frustration for parking spots at local malls in recentdays only, I assure you, to provide some firsthand independentresearch concerning the strength of Christmas spending. [Laughter]Frankly, my concern with the possibility that consumer spending may betoo robust rather than too weak has increased. At a minimum, therisks with respect to consumption now seem to me to be quite balanced.However, moderation in government spending and residential investmentcombined with the significant drag from net exports--and that drag hasbeen revised upward in the latest Greenbook due to the stronger dollaras Ted Truman mentioned--those sources of drag, I think, should offsetabove-trend growth in consumption and investment spending over theforecast period. If we add to that the fact that inventories areseemingly at reasonable levels in relation to sales, the Greenbookforecast of overall growth in demand seems perfectly plausible withthe risks looking quite balanced, as Governor Meyer stated a minuteago. In fact, this stunning combination of strongcorporate profits, a healthy but sustainable pace of real growth, lowand maybe even declining inflation, and lower real interest rates dueto enhanced prospects of a balanced budget is a mix that may indeedcontinue to support a level of stock prices that the Greenbook--Iliked the staff's term for this--called aggressive.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  The Twelfth District economy gained momentum in recent months and is expanding in line with the nation. Consumer spending rose smartly, and our contacts report that price discounting for a variety of small retail items has declined as demand has grown. District housing markets saw strong price appreciation and strong sales. We are also seeing a continued general recovery in the manufacturing sector as rapid growth in exports, especially to East Asia, has propelled strong gains in overall output and sales. Job growth has also gained momentum in the West—especially outside California, which has lagged a bit in recent months. Recent data suggest that economic growth in the second half of the year will be reasonably strong, and the most likely outcome over the next couple of years seems to be that the pace of growth will exceed potential, bringing the economy gradually back toward full employment. What is new about the outlook compared with May is the strong employment growth reported for fiscal stimulus wanes, to support the very desirable projections for economic activity and inflation that are outlined in the Greenbook. One that David emphasized has been particularly important to us in our analysis—namely, that profit margins have been extraordinarily large and the markup of goods prices over unit labor costs in level terms has risen to a new high. This large markup could return to more normal levels through falling inflation or through faster growth in labor compensation or a combination of the two.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Improved labor markets and rising wages have begun to attract job seekers and, after falling for several years, labor force participation has picked up somewhat in many District states and the fraction of the unemployed that were either new or returning entrants has increased. Turning to the national outlook, disappointing data for June and the July employment report have caused us to revise down our real GDP forecast and have elevated our concern about downside risks to the outlook. Consumers kept up their spending throughout the recession and recovery despite only modest income growth. With interest rates rising and equity prices declining notably since our last meeting, households might try to get their finances in order and bring the saving rate up to more normal levels. An alternative scenario in the   Greenbook suggests that an increase in the saving rate to 1 percentage point higher than the baseline would lower real GDP growth about a percentage point, to a sluggish 2½ percent in 2005—and it would be even less given the revised staff forecast. With consumer confidence strong and disposable income likely growing at a solid rate, even with weak job growth in July, I agree that the odds are good that the economy will soon rebound from the late spring and early summer doldrums. In view of the recent weakness in the economic data and the downgrading of the forecast, I would favor modifying the final sentence in our statement to indicate that we intend to fulfill our obligations to promote both price stability and sustainable growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Since our last meeting, economic activity in the Twelfth District has continued to expand at a solid pace but more slowly than earlier in the year. Turning to the national economy, recent data suggest that the sharp slowing in activity in encouraging, and the drop in oil prices from recent highs should also help. While all of this is good news, we still haven’t seen real strength in job growth, and it’s not yet clear whether output growth will return to the robust rates of last year or something much closer to the growth rate of potential. In this regard, the Greenbook presents a rather sober view of the economic outlook, despite its assumption of persistently low real interest rates. Finally, I remain concerned about the potential for weakness in consumer spending, which could restrain growth even more than the Greenbook envisions. In spite of only modest income growth, consumer spending provided critical support for aggregate demand during the recession and afterward, and the saving rate remains at an extremely low level. Overall, it’s a bit of a mystery why this expansion has not been marked by faster average growth together with a larger reduction in the amount of slack, given persistently easy financial conditions, including the low levels of real interest rates, as well as the decline in the dollar and the increase in equity prices over the past year or so.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Finally, job gains remain modest in the District, and unemployment has inched down only slightly. Turning to the national economy, recent data on economic activity have flashed both positive and negative signals, but on balance they suggest that growth is sustainable though trendlike—not nearly as robust as the strength we saw last year. In spite of the small uptick in the unemployment rate, October’s stunning job growth raises the odds that labor market slack will mitigates the downside risk to consumer spending from muted growth in personal income. Third, there’s a good prospect that the private saving rate will rise from its current low level once housing-price appreciation moderates and the growth in wealth that consumers experience as a consequence starts to taper off. Fourth, it seems likely that the trade gap will continue to drag down growth, even though the dollar has fallen somewhat since we last met. As David noted, the Greenbook forecast for IT investment has been revised down rather significantly in the last two rounds in response to disappointing data that showed real growth of only 4¼ percent in the third quarter. As Governor Ferguson noted in a recent speech and in his remarks to the Committee last time, the more moderate pace of decline in quality-adjusted computer prices over the last year industry opinion that the pace of the development of software is beginning to slow. I suppose if one interprets the employment report as a very strong signal—and perhaps this is the view that you were expressing—that structural productivity growth is lower than we had been assuming, then this B′ statement would be an appropriate response.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The November employment report was disappointing, but taken in the context of the last several months of job growth and other data, I have become more confident that the economy has found solid footing. Even so, it is notable that output growth so far has only moderately exceeded potential despite huge doses of fiscal and monetary medicine. As we discussed at the last meeting, the recent moderation in the pace of price declines for high-tech goods, coupled with weakness in high-tech investment last quarter, hints at the possibility of less-robust productivity growth going forward. Some people argue that improved productivity growth since 2000 is largely temporary and will reverse over the next few years. Proponents of this view expect caution to dissipate and productivity growth to slow as firms become more confident about the outlook. But if business caution in making long-term commitments were the primary motive for weak job growth, we would expect—but do not see—employment expanding along other margins, such as the workweek. We now realize that a considerable amount of the investment during the late 1990s had a low or even a negative rate of return, biasing up standard estimates of the contribution to productivity growth from capital deepening. This pace is about equal to the average rate of productivity growth during the last seven years, including periods of both high and low investment. Given the costs of an unexpected and substantial decline in inflation, these risks should be a significant concern.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A numerical objective might also reduce the potential for destabilizing inflation scares following adverse supply shocks, enhancing the scope for monetary policy to respond to their real effects. The public enunciation of a long-run inflation objective I think also enhances accountability and transparency, and those are desirable goals that we should pursue. The potential negative impact of downward nominal wage rigidity on real economic performance diminishes, however, as productivity and hence average wage growth rises. But I think it’s important to emphasize that this forecast, which calls for growth only moderately above potential with a very gradual diminution of the remaining labor market slack, depends on a very gradual pace of monetary tightening. In contrast, such traditional measures as the dispersion in industry employment growth rates revealed the last recession and jobless recovery that followed to be a period of low, not high, sectoral reallocation. One sign that mismatch is not unusually high, at least during the recovery period, comes from data on job creation and job destruction. A shifting out of the Beveridge curve, signaling higher levels of vacancies coexisting with any given level of unemployment, would provide evidence of increased mismatch. However, analysis by our staff shows that since the onset of the recession, the unemployment paths of less- and more-educated workers have been similar, and the change in compensation growth for lower-skilled occupations has been at least as rapid as for occupations requiring higher skills.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The strength in orders and shipments for core capital goods, despite the expiration of partial expensing, was particularly significant. In the Greenbook, all of this good news appears to show up mostly in the form of higher interest rates that offset the upward pressure on growth in the second half of this year and in 2006. Taken together, these developments helped to assuage concerns about a pronounced slowdown in productivity growth, and I remain optimistic that advances in this area will continue to boost output growth and restrain inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield even now is below its level in         whether term premiums have fallen to levels that are lower than can be justified by fundamentals. If the term premium is abnormally low now, economic growth could be significantly dampened if the term premium suddenly returns to more normal levels. Using the approach that yielded the larger term premium conundrum, our analysis suggests that about one-third—about 12 basis points—of the intermeeting increase is due to the correction of the low term premium. The remaining two-thirds is split between a higher path for expected future short-term real interest rates, presumably due to strong economic news, and higher inflation expectations. But I do not think we should overreact to January’s adverse inflation data, especially in light of the continued containment of wages and salaries and evidence of even greater strength in actual and structural productivity growth than previously assumed in the staff forecast.\n",

      " The latest data on employment, retail sales, and durable goods orders reveal unanticipated weakness on the real side of the economy. If the current situation persists or deteriorates further, we could face some difficult policy choices ahead, but I remain cautiously optimistic that the slowdown in growth and the uptick in inflation will both prove transitory. Corroborating this view, our contacts, even in some of the most rapidly growing areas of the Twelfth District, report little trouble filling job openings except in some skilled trades that are in high demand in construction. The constancy of long-run inflation expectations provides some reassurance, although I worry that if we had similar readings on such expectations in the early 1970s, they would have been slow to rise then as well, as bond markets had grown complacent about inflation. [Laughter] In my view, even with appropriate monetary policy action, the risk to the attainment of sustainable growth is unbalanced to the downside, while the risk to the attainment of price stability is unbalanced to the upside. Releasing an unchanged balance-of-risk statement might suggest to some that this Committee has ignored the palpable shift in economic conditions toward higher inflation and slower growth. Maybe at that time a simple statement that says something like this will be the sensible way to go:  “Under current conditions, policy seems well positioned to achieve our dual goals and we will respond, as needed, to fulfill our obligations to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.”\n",

      " We’ve had changes in the rules for tax exemption and in 1997 on capital gains from the sale of primary residences that would make holding real estate assets more attractive. But an alternative perspective on that is that high house prices, in fact, are curtailing effective demand for housing at this point and that house appreciation probably is poised to slow. So the increasing use of creative financing could be a sign of the final gasps of house-price appreciation at the pace we’ve seen and an indication that a slowing is at hand. The most worrisome factor is that oil prices have risen further, although this should tend to boost core inflation more this year than next year. On the encouraging side, I see a noticeable decline— about 17 basis points—in inflation compensation at both the 5- and 10-year horizons, high markups, an appreciation in the dollar, a leveling off of commodity prices, very modest increases in the ECI, still rather robust structural productivity growth, and some indications of remaining slack. The situation with regard to slack, as David noted and emphasized, is complicated because the unemployment rate is relatively low, near most estimates of NAIRU. In fact, respectable and not stellar growth is all we have gotten, even with exceptionally low long-term yields and unexpectedly rapid gains in house prices. [Laughter]  My point is that to offset the drags, we’ve needed to give the economy a strong dose of stimulus, which inevitably boosted the housing sector—and that just to get reasonable economic growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It would take a drop in structural productivity growth to boost inflation. As discussed in the Greenbook, the recent benchmark revisions probably do warrant a modest decrease in our estimates of structural productivity growth, which does add to inflation pressures, making the outlook a bit less favorable than I originally thought. Nevertheless, it is         encouraging that, even after a downward adjustment, productivity still seems to be growing somewhat faster than the robust rates achieved in the second half of the ’90s. This interpretation is supported by the smaller increase reported in this morning’s release on the second quarter and from readings from the employment cost index, which excludes these items and has shown only modest increases. Furthermore, recent increases in labor compensation could be part of the process by which labor’s share of GPD is returning to more normal levels, following a period of unusually rapid growth in profits that has been pushing up capital’s share. Indeed, our contacts are telling us that in the absence of much pricing power, increases in labor costs are hurting their bottom lines. With this technology the firm has been able to shed workers who check the wells manually, and it has decreased the down time of wells in the network. So for all of these reasons, I’m inclined to think that inflationary concerns about unit labor costs should be focused more on possible changes in structural productivity growth than long-term labor compensation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " There was some early concern that Gulf Port cargo would be diverted to the West Coast, creating bottlenecks or significantly increasing shipping costs, but these concerns have largely dissipated. Even before the hurricane, they were worried that higher gasoline prices and impending increases in home heating expenses would curb consumer demand. It now seems likely that second-half growth will be substantially reduced due to the disruptions to production in the Gulf region and the negative impact of the run-up in energy prices on consumer spending. While the proposed policy statement associated with alternative B acknowledges increased uncertainty about economic performance in the near term, I believe that the uncertainties associated with the medium-term outlook have also risen substantially, and risks now exist that in my view pose a clear and persistent threat. The recovery and bounceback fueled by massive fiscal stimulus could more than make up for the slowdown this winter, propelling the economy on an unsustainable upward trajectory similar to the optimistic scenario laid out in the Greenbook. Moreover, the pace of restarting closed oil and natural gas platforms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico has leveled off, and the prognosis for restarting the remaining closed facilities as well as refineries and natural gas treatment plants remains in question. The elevated rate of growth in compensation per hour from the productivity and cost report over the past year far exceeds the readings provided by these other series and may be more an outlier than a strong signal of tight labor markets and wage pressures.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " At our last meeting I was optimistic that we would avoid a brush with stagflation despite the higher energy prices and the setback in production from Katrina. They do note that there has been some success in passing energy cost increases down the supply chain but, given competitive pressures and the lack of pricing power, they tell us that the buck usually stops before the consumer. Obviously, forecasting beyond that is hazardous, but looking out toward Christmas, I thought I would note that one of the country’s largest growers of poinsettias is on our Advisory Council, and he is highly confident that there will be little pass-through of energy costs into retail poinsettia prices. Let me give a concrete example based on alternative C. If the Committee believes, for example, that further tightening remains necessary once policy is no longer accommodative, it could state, following the rationale section, that “under these conditions the Committee perceives that further policy firming is likely to be necessary,” or “will be necessary,” or “might be necessary.”  “Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to any changes in economic prospects to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability and foster sustainable growth.” Once the Committee feels that further tightening is not necessary, it could state that “under these conditions the Committee perceives that the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate going forward.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As rebuilding winds down and the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening take hold, it seems plausible that growth will slow toward potential, keeping unemployment around the current level of 5 percent, the scenario envisioned in the Greenbook. The economy’s remarkable resilience in the face of devastating hurricanes and three years of rising energy prices suggest that the expansion has gained footing and no longer needs support from monetary policy accommodation. Of course, even though recent core inflation data look pretty darn good, there may be forces at work that could undermine price stability. The first risk to price stability is that, contrary to the Greenbook forecast, growth may not actually subside toward potential. A sustained slowdown in productivity growth would pose a more challenging dilemma for policy and the inflation outlook. Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector grew more than 3 percent over the past year, beating out previous estimates of structural         productivity growth of around 2¾ percent. Given the sluggish adjustment of wages to changes in productivity, the stronger path of productivity reduces the rate of growth of unit labor costs, putting downward pressure on inflation. I won’t repeat those arguments today but simply note, once again, that core PCE inflation has actually moderated, despite a nearly 30 percent increase in energy prices over the past year, on top of a 15 percent rise in the previous year. We conclude from this empirical work that an increase in inflation due to a sharp acceleration in compensation growth is, at most, an upside risk to inflation and not the most probable outcome.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But there are good reasons to believe that much of the softness will prove temporary, so I tend to agree with the Greenbook and other forecasts in expecting a rather sharp rebound in the current quarter. It is not inconceivable that the weak numbers for the fourth quarter could presage a more-prolonged, sluggish phase as the lagged effects of past policy tightening and higher oil prices take effect. This caution is heightened by my concern that the economy faces some pretty big downside risks, especially having to do with the interrelated issues of possible overvaluations in housing markets and low term premiums in bond markets. These risks are highlighted by the alternative simulations in the Greenbook concerning a rise in the saving rate and a higher term premium. But assuming that growth slows to trend later this year, my outlook for inflation in 2006 is more optimistic than the Greenbook. The Greenbook shows an increase of 2¼ percent this year, presumably reflecting larger energy-price pass-through, and then a drop to about 1¾ percent in 2007 as the effects of energy prices subside. [Laughter] Positive though the situation is, it also obviously raises the issue of how much higher the funds rate needs to go to keep the economy on this desirable trajectory. The results are that, after adding importantly to growth over the last few years, past policy accommodation is roughly neutral in terms of growth this year and next.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " David mentioned that we only need to see a modest slowing or a downturn in the housing sector to realize sustainable growth going forward. As I compare the Greenbook forecast to Macroeconomic Advisers’ forecast, the thing that really stands out, and has stood out for quite a long time, as a consistent, strong difference is the Greenbook’s forecast that net exports will be a growing drag on the economy and Macroeconomic Advisers’ view that net exports are just poised to turn up. And this dynamic model suggests that, even with fast economic growth, the unemployment rate will likely be pushed up a bit this year, as this unusual So to sum up, I see steady growth and few pressures for price acceleration. The unemployment rate has declined unusually rapidly over the last year, but a simple Okun’s law calculation—and I think that the staff has commented on this in the past, if I’m not mistaken—would assess the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate during 2005 as especially large, given what output growth was. In terms of risk assessments, I share Governor Kohn’s concern about the possibility that growth won’t actually slow to a sustainable pace and so the economy may overheat. But I am also concerned about overshooting, in part because the delayed effect of our policy actions may show up especially in the housing sector with greater force than we expect and we are a little uncertain—David mentioned this yesterday—about just what the spillovers might be to consumer spending via balance sheet effects or wealth effects.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We see growth coming in slightly below trend starting in the second half of this year and the unemployment rate moving up toward 5 percent. A second possibility is that higher U.S. interest rates reflect a shift in global capital flows away from the United States, perhaps due to the unwinding of the carry trade or growing concern about the U.S. current account deficit. But the inflation risk premium could also be higher because the world now strikes market participants as a riskier place, perhaps because of geopolitical concerns that have nothing to do with credibility. Indeed, a growing perception that the world is riskier could explain both the uptick in inflation compensation due to a rise in the inflation risk premium and some of the rise in TIPS yields due to higher real interest rate risk. I do think a bit more tightening is needed because I’d prefer to see core inflation gradually head down toward the center of my comfort range rather than see it stabilize in the vicinity of 2 percent, as in the Greenbook forecast. I want to emphasize that only a bit is required, not a show of overwhelming force, because, as one example, the benchmark Taylor rule would suggest that a ½ percent reduction in the target inflation rate, say from 2 to 1½, the center of my comfort zone, calls for an additional increase of only 25 basis points in the funds rate, and various simulations using optimal policies as opposed to rules would similarly show a quite slow convergence toward the lower target rate.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Under the assumption of one more funds rate increase at this meeting, it seems reasonable to me that growth will remain somewhat below its potential rate, that the unemployment rate will gradually trend upward to slightly above the NAIRU by the end of next year, and that core inflation will gradually move down toward my comfort zone. My concern is that it is very difficult at this stage to rule out a much less desirable scenario in which the lagged effects of our earlier reactions restrain activity more strongly and more persistently than we now expect. I am concerned about downside risks to the real outlook, especially until we can better gauge the magnitude of the repercussions from the weakening in housing markets that now clearly is under way. Perhaps with higher mortgage interest rates and lower expectations of house-price appreciation, speculative properties are being dumped into the market, and families in the market for housing are now more inclined to rent rather than buy, driving rents up and housing prices down. It seems to me that, in the policy round coming up, the more important matters are the risks that growth could slow much more than now seems likely or that inflation could prove to be a more serious problem than I currently expect it to be or, for that matter, that both factors could come into play. I am deeply concerned about the pace of core inflation in recent months, but as I said yesterday, I take comfort from the continued strength in productivity growth, modest increases in wages, and the high level of markups.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nonfarm payroll employment has shifted down to a more-sustainable pace, and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.8 percent, just a bit below standard estimates of the NAIRU. I will be watching the incoming data closely for signs as to whether the housing slowdown remains orderly as hoped or takes a steeper downward slide, posing a greater risk to the economy. First, the rate of labor productivity growth over the past three years has been a bit slower than we thought, primarily because of downward revisions to the rate of capital accumulation, so that the Greenbook now projects structural productivity growth of 2.7 percent, about ¼ percentage point slower than we thought back in June. As I mentioned at the last meeting, we just don’t have a good handle on why core inflation has risen of late or how persistent this rise will be. As I said, there’s no doubt in my mind that you can make a good case for raising rates today, and frankly I probably would have ended up favoring that myself, despite the associated risk to growth, if I thought there were an imminent danger of our losing our inflation-fighting credibility with the markets and the general public. I do greatly favor increasing clarity concerning the Committee’s long-term inflation objective, but frankly I’m uncertain which approach is going to be the most attractive to accomplish that.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In terms of economic activity, the recent news has been uniformly negative, resulting in a significant downward revision to growth in the Greenbook. In the view of our contacts, the data lag reality, and it seems a good bet that things will get worse before they get better. He had toured some new subdivisions on the outskirts of Boise and discovered that the houses, most of which are unoccupied, are now being dressed up to look occupied—with curtains, things in the driveway, and so forth—so as not to discourage potential buyers. Now, as David noted, the Greenbook has completely offset the favorable effects on core inflation from lower energy prices by boosting the growth rate of labor costs. As I mentioned at our last meeting, it may be unduly pessimistic to assume that the recent rise in inflation will be highly persistent. Recently our staff examined persistence at a more disaggregated level and found that the same general pattern also holds for each of the major components of the core PCE price index, with price inflation for durables only slightly more persistent than price inflation for nondurables and services. I think the inflation outlook is slightly improved because of the reduction in energy and commodity prices, and growth during the second half of the year now appears quite likely to fall short of trend. I view the risks to the attainment of our objectives as more balanced than they were in August, and I certainly judge the downside risks to growth to have increased.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It falls just 0.1 percent by the end of 2008 in the negative housing shock scenario, even though unemployment rises to 6 percent. The housing correction shock has a perverse effect on core inflation in mid-2007, with inflation actually up in the weak demand scenario and down a bit in the case where demand strengthens. My staff tells me that the Fed’s cut to address the weakness then raises expected inflation, which passes through into inflation in these scenarios, and that’s why we get a stronger housing correction perversely raising inflation. However, equity valuations for homebuilders, as Cathy mentioned, have risen moderately in the past couple of months, following large declines over the previous year, and we interpret that as providing some indication that the expected future path of home prices has at least stopped deteriorating. While this is a possibility, it seems more likely to me that households ran down their savings to fill their gas tanks when gas prices rose and are, therefore, likely to use their recent savings at the pump to bolster their finances, at least partly. Overall, under the assumption of an unchanged funds rate, our forecast shows a beautiful soft landing, with real GDP growing at a moderately below-trend pace for a few more quarters and homing in near trend thereafter. We have core PCE price inflation edging down from just under 2½ percent this year to just over 2 percent in 2007 and see a good chance that it may fall a bit below 2 percent in the following year.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " An alternative possibility is that the output gap is more positive than assumed in the Greenbook because of lower growth in potential output or more-rapid growth in actual output. If the gross domestic income measure ends up being more accurate, then the decline in the unemployment rate this year would not be surprising. But that, in turn, conflicts with the data on productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector, which have been weak, not strong. But there is reason to believe that this decline may overstate the slowing in productivity growth, given continued strong growth in productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector. But there are sizable risks on both sides to the outlook for growth, and the downside risks are now more palpable. There is, likewise, a great deal of uncertainty about inflation going forward; in this case, the risks remain biased to the high side. A further rate increase at this time would unnecessarily increase the odds of a much sharper and more-damaging economic slowdown. Inflation may not come down as desired, and a further rate increase may be needed or, hard as it is to imagine, market participants may end up being right that the economy will slow much faster than we anticipate and call for rate cuts. So I fear that alternative B, section 2, leaves the false impression that we have significantly revised downward both our view of the outlook for growth and, accordingly, our estimate of inflation risks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For 2007 as a whole, we have revised up our projection for real GDP growth about ¼ percentage point, to about 2¾ percent, which is just a bit below our estimate of the trend, which is a bit higher than the Greenbook. Even so, Okun’s law still suggests that the excess demand in labor markets as reflected in the low unemployment rate is abnormally large relative to that in goods markets as reflected in estimates of the output gap. While I remain concerned about the risk that labor market pressures could boost inflation over time, I’m still fairly optimistic about the outlook for inflation overall. While there are risks on both sides of the outlook for growth, I’m a little more focused on the upside risks after the recent spate of strong data. However, there’s a great deal of uncertainty about inflation going forward, and to me these risks remain biased to the high side. Housing remains a concern, but I think the prospects for a really serious housing collapse that spreads to consumer spending have diminished substantially. In recent years we have made notable strides toward increasing transparency, and that has served to enhance public accountability and to improve the efficacy of policymaking. They seem to be the largest to produce a unified forecast, but the process is reportedly time-consuming and contentious, and I fear that the attempt to arrive at a single forecast could end up undermining our collegiality, not to mention our effectiveness.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " This pace of growth is substantially below potential, and we expect the unemployment rate to start to edge up fairly quickly. Even relative to this lower baseline, I think the downside risks to the prospects for output growth have sharpened in the intermeeting period. This unwillingness reflects his difficulty in identifying deals that are likely to yield adequate returns even though, for the buyout firms, debt also is available in what they depict as very attractive so-called covenant-lite terms—perhaps too attractive given the vulnerability of some of the highly leveraged yields. So just as we have seen in mortgage markets, the bubble in private equity, as my sources characterize it, and the overabundance of liquidity more generally raise the risk of a sharp retrenchment in credit and higher risk spreads with associated risks to economic growth and, conceivably, even financial stability. The continued low unemployment rate, coupled with recent sluggish output growth, suggests via Okun’s law that potential output could be growing in the vicinity of 2¼ percent. So for me, the risks do seem more balanced in the sense that there are downside risks to real activity and upside risks to inflation; and I think it is appropriate—I agree with Cathy’s comments—to reflect that in the statement. It’s a question of weighing the gains from being at a better number against the transition costs, and I thought about that tradeoff when I decided on 1½.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " This slowdown in consumption is reinforced by more-moderate gains in personal income, as the unemployment rate gradually rises, reaching 5 percent in 2009. Overall, I’m more optimistic regarding inflation than the Greenbook and anticipate that core PCE price inflation will edge down below 2 percent after next year. One of the more interesting questions about the outlook, as David noted in the questions to him, is how to reconcile the strong labor market performance with the weak growth in output or, equivalently, how much of the recent slowdown in productivity growth is likely to persist. Relative to the second half of the 1990s, both the pace of productivity growth in the IT sector and the pace of investment in equipment and software have slowed, and these factors have probably depressed trend productivity growth slightly in recent years and are likely to continue depressing it somewhat going forward. So such weakness could reflect lower assessments by companies of their ability to improve productivity through the installation of new capital, and that is, I think, consistent with the lower trend of productivity growth. But you would think that a marked slowdown in secular productivity growth would also result in downward revisions to the expected paths of future profits and real wages, weakening equity market valuations and crimping consumption growth. If we were to move, I wouldn’t have a problem with the language in C about inflation and uncertainty, but I would also want to add something about uncertainty with respect to growth, and I see no need to make this change today.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In addition, housing prices are unlikely to rise over the next few years and, indeed, may well fall, and the absence of the housing wealth gains realized in the past should damp consumption spending. My forecast is for growth to be around 2½ percent in the second half of this year and in 2008, slightly below my estimate of potential growth, and for the unemployment rate to edge up gradually, reaching nearly 5 percent by the end of next year. The risk for further significant deterioration in the housing market, with house prices falling and mortgage delinquencies rising further, causes me appreciable angst. They found that low rates of house price appreciation, and especially house price decelerations, are associated with increases in delinquency rates even after controlling for local economic conditions such as employment growth and the unemployment rate. These results highlight the potential risks that rising defaults in subprime could spread to other sectors of the mortgage market and could trigger a vicious cycle in which a further deceleration in house prices increases foreclosures, in turn exacerbating downside price movements. Although recent productivity data have been disappointing, I expressed some optimism at the last meeting about productivity growth on the grounds that at least some of the slowdown appeared to reflect labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment to output, especially in the construction industry. They will certainly note the omission of the term “somewhat elevated.”  It will raise a question about whether, if core inflation were to stabilize at 2 percent, we would be satisfied with that or we would want to see it move lower.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The drop in equity prices and rising rates on most risky corporate debt are further negatives for growth. On balance, however, I expect these offsets to be only partial, providing a cushion against future weakness, because I interpret the decline in Treasury rates during the intermeeting period primarily as a reflection of weaker growth expectations and a correspondingly lower path for the expected future fed funds rate and not a consequence of the fall of the term premium. My assessment of the neutral federal funds rate declined during the intermeeting period for two main reasons—first, because of the tightening in financial conditions associated with the reassessment of risk now taking place and, second, because of the NIPA revisions, which suggest slower structural productivity growth and, in all likelihood, correspondingly slower growth in aggregate demand. When you say “although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate,” that’s like saying—perhaps because I respond so strongly to the word “predominant”—that, yes, we see greater downside risk, but we don’t care; we remain totally focused on inflation. If financial turbulence diminishes and markets stabilize, not having downside risks to growth in paragraph 4 and continuing to express some asymmetric bias, some worry about inflation, we’ll be comfortable living with that going forward, and it is a good summary of where we are.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Readings on core inflation during the intermeeting period have continued to be encouraging, and the downward trend has persisted long enough that I’ve lowered my inflation forecast slightly. With the weaker outlook for growth, I also see less upside inflation risk emanating from cyclical pressures. But such an approach would be misguided and fraught with hazard because it would deprive us of the opportunity to act in time to forestall the likely damage. Of course, risk spreads in credit markets are up across a broad range of instruments and for most borrowers, both corporate and households. It is riskier corporate borrowers and households seeking nonconforming mortgage loans, including jumbos, that have seen their borrowing rates rise over the past few months. But importantly, it is the drop in Treasury yields, about 50 to 100 basis points since early July, that has thus far shielded so many borrowers from higher interest rates, and of course, this drop reflects the market’s expectations that the Committee will ease the stance of monetary policy rather substantially. A big worry is that a significant drop in house prices might occur in the context of job losses, and this could lead to a vicious spiral of foreclosures, further weakness in housing markets, and further reductions in consumer spending. I thought the Bluebook gave us a good method for seeing how much more in showing that the Greenbook implicit equilibrium funds rate has declined 50 basis points since to forestall it from damaging the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " With respect to economic activity, we have raised our forecast for growth in both the third and the fourth quarters in response to incoming data, even though the pace of deterioration in the housing sector has been more severe than we expected and the problems associated with housing finance seem far from resolution. Survey measures of consumer confidence are down sharply since the financial turmoil began, and most indexes of house prices show outright declines. The bottom line is that consumption spending seems to be all right for the time being, but there is a real risk that households may cut back on spending more than expected in response to higher oil prices, a slower economy, and economic uncertainty. My impression is that, despite having moved in a positive direction over the past six weeks, these markets remain vulnerable to shocks, and so the economy remains at risk from further financial disruptions. Second, one important aspect of the financial turmoil is that it probably represents in part a movement toward a more reasonable pricing of risk, as seen in the rise in risk spreads. I see the risk to my inflation forecast as moderate and mainly to the upside in view of recent increases in oil and food prices, declines in the dollar, and a slower rate of structural productivity growth. In my view, the more serious risk is the one that our Chairman discussed yesterday of unleashing negative nonlinear dynamics in the real and financial economy that could be difficult to reverse.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But if house prices and the stock market fall further and the economy appears to be weakening, then they will further tighten the lending conditions and terms on consumer loans to avoid problems down the road, and these fears could be self-fulfilling. If banks only partially replace the collapsed shadow banks or, worse, if they cut back their lending in anticipation of a worsening economy, then the resulting credit crunch could push us into recession. Continued increases in energy and import prices pose some upside risk to the inflation outlook, but there are also downside risks to inflation associated with a weakening economy and rising unemployment. To sum up, I believe that the most likely outcome is for the economy to slow significantly in the near term, flirting with recession, and I view the risk to that scenario as being weighted significantly to the downside. I think the headwinds from financial market turmoil and the more general reassessment of risks that is taking place in global markets are good reasons why the equilibrium real rate may be low in the current situation. To my mind, the risk to the forecast and the risk of a vicious cycle, in which deteriorating financial conditions and a weakening economy and house prices feed on each other, argue for adopting a risk-management strategy that, at the very minimum, moves our policy stance to the low end of neutral—namely, a cut of 50 basis points—and I think it argues for doing so now rather than taking a “wait and see” approach and lowering it only grudgingly.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The household survey also contains other signs of a weakening job market:  a 25 percent increase in the unemployment rate for job losers, which accounts for the lion’s share of the overall increase in aggregate unemployment; an increase in the number of newly unemployed job losers, which can be thought of as a broader measure than UI claims of inflows into unemployment; and an increase of 5 to 10 percent in the estimated expected completed duration of an unemployment spell, suggesting a reduced pace of outflows from unemployment. With the aggregate unemployment rate now up only 0.6 percentage point off its low, I would describe the deterioration in the labor market thus far as modest, but it is noteworthy that an increase in unemployment of this magnitude, in the space of 12 months, has occurred only twice since 1948 outside of recessions. Therefore, I would definitely retain the sentence in alternative B, paragraph 4, that states, “However, downside risks to growth remain.”  However, I could see a case, following President Plosser’s suggestion, to substitute the wording from the last sentence of the the words “will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth” for the words “will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.”  This seems to me to be a small change that would, taken together with the new first sentence in paragraph 4, slightly dial down the perceived odds of further cuts relative to the proposed wording in B.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My overall sense at this point is that the effects of the severe and prolonged housing downturn, the financial market implosion, and the price increases for oil and other commodities have now spread to most corners of the economy, including the major segments of consumption and business fixed investment. Exports represent about the only source of strength, and while that is welcome, I must say that the economy is pretty clearly in trouble when the contribution to real GDP growth from exports exceeds overall real GDP growth, as may well happen this year. For example, the CEO of a large high-end national retail operation reports that for January and These declines have created tremendous pressure on inventory levels requiring large markdowns with negative effects on profits. In one example, the CEO of a bank in my District reports that several of the nation’s largest mortgage lenders have suspended withdrawals from open home equity lines out of concern that borrowers could now owe more than their homes are worth. Recent increases in inflation compensation in Treasury markets highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with problems in the real economy possibly could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion of our inflation credibility. But having spent some time thinking about it, I think that a lower funds rate will actually lower long-term rates, in part because, by reducing the probability of a financial crisis, we will bring risk premiums down, which will lower long-term rates.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In looking at the latest Blue Chip forecasts for GDP growth, I noted that the range between the highest and lowest is among the largest on record. I think it is the case that, if the interest elasticity is relatively small, the dead weight loss from the reserve tax is relatively small, and the net welfare gain, taking into account the burdens of raising other taxes to make up for the lost seigniorage, in effect, could easily turn out to be negative. He looks at this issue in that context, and he concludes that there would be net social losses, not gains, from the reduction in seigniorage that would be associated with a move to zero inflation from positive inflation because the dead weight loss due to the shoe-leather cost, also known as the Bailey effect, is smaller than the dead weight losses that would be associated with alternative taxes. Another comment on the issue of objectives:  If we are coming out with a white paper, it seems to me that the objective that everybody is now discussing and that was just discussed—namely, that paying interest on reserves would enable us to expand the size of our balance sheet in times of financial crisis, like now, and perhaps greatly enhance the scope for liquidity-altering interventions that would be possible without having to push the federal funds rate to zero—is a real improvement in the tool kit that is available to us to address market disruptions.\n",

      " Real-side data came in considerably stronger than I anticipated, so like the Greenbook I have adjusted up my forecast for growth in the current quarter. At the same time, the adverse fundamentals that will weigh on household and business spending going forward have grown somewhat heavier overall, and that has prompted me to revise down my growth forecast for the second half. Nonetheless, given that the prices of many commodities have continued to rise more rapidly than I anticipated and that some measures of inflation expectations have turned up, I have adjusted up my inflation forecast for 2008, considerably up for headline inflation and modestly up for core inflation. The strong incoming data on spending eased my fears that we are in or are approaching a recession regime of the sort embedded in the last two Greenbooks. Given the overhang of homes for sale, the recent rise in mortgage rates, and the fact that the homeownership rate is likely to continue trending lower, I think the downward pressure on home prices and construction will persist, as the Greenbook suggests. There is a clear risk, then, that the combination of declining housing wealth and tightening credit could lead households to restrict spending more, and more persistently, than anticipated. I have viewed this as appropriate, not largely as insurance against downside risk but simply in refection of the unusually severe pressures from collapsing wealth and tight credit and financial constraints.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Developments during the intermeeting period have heightened my concern about downside risks to economic growth and slightly allayed my concern about upside risks to inflation. For example, a large bank in my District has begun now in earnest to cancel or cap outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit, despite an ongoing concern about alienating consumers. Unfortunately, the risk of an adverse feedback loop from tighter credit to higher unemployment, to rising foreclosures, to escalating financial sector losses, to yet tighter credit remains alive and well, in my opinion. Indeed, stress tests conducted by some of the large financial institutions in our District reveal an exceptionally high sensitivity of credit losses to both home-price movements and unemployment. But to the extent that the decline in oil prices partly reflects reduced expectations for global growth, the net impetus from stronger domestic spending will be offset by weaker export growth. Growth in our two broad measures of labor compensation are low and stable; and taking productivity growth into account, unit labor costs have risen only modestly. [Laughter]  So I propose to create it by changing the wording of the first sentence of alternative B, paragraph 4, to read, “Both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are of significant concern to the Committee.”  As it is currently worded, B(4) downplays the downside risks to growth, which have intensified since our last meeting as the credit crunch has worsened and emphasizes inflation risks, which have moderated slightly as oil prices have fallen.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I expect as a consequence that core inflation will remain uncomfortably high for a while longer, but the marked decline in commodity prices since June reinforces my conviction that there is light at the end of this inflation tunnel. With respect to growth, our forecast is similar to the Greenbook’s, with a little more weakness in the second half of this year and a little more strength in 2009. I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that the strength we saw in the upwardly revised real GDP growth in the second quarter will not hold up. [Laughter] Exports were a huge source of strength in the second quarter, but I am concerned that we cannot count on very large contributions to growth from exports going forward, now that the dollar has begun to rise and economic growth abroad has slowed, even turning negative in some important trade partners. The interaction of higher unemployment with the housing and financial markets raises the potential for even worse news—namely, an intensification of the adverse feedback loop we have long worried about and are now experiencing. I anticipate that the recent jump in the unemployment rate will place some additional downward pressure on growth in labor compensation, which has been quite low, and in core inflation. In view of the intensified financial stress and the potential for more turmoil, obviously I think we will need to be flexible in setting policy going forward, and I am very concerned about downside risks to the real economy and think that inflation risk is diminished.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In fact, I think we will be lucky if the adverse feedback loop that is under way doesn’t wrench us into a much more pronounced and more protracted downturn. In fact, I am concerned that beyond next year we run the risk of inflation falling below the level consistent with price stability. This sentiment is echoed by a large retailer who says simply, “The holiday shopping season is going to stink.” Businesses are under siege from weak demand, high costs of borrowing, curtailed credit availability, and pervasive uncertainty about how long such conditions will last. With financing unavailable, I am hearing talk about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned improvements on existing buildings, as well as the potential for distress sales of properties whose owners will be unable to roll over debt as it matures. Baa corporate bonds are up about 200 basis points since our last meeting, low-grade corporate bonds are up a staggering 700 basis points, and to top it all, the dollar has appreciated nearly 10 percent against the currencies of our trading partners. But we are fighting an uphill battle against falling home prices, an economy in recession, and collapsing confidence. The interaction of higher unemployment and rising delinquencies raises the potential for even greater losses by banks and other financial institutions and for an intensification of the adverse feedback loop we have worried about and are now experiencing.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The institutional concerns about Treasury fails and Treasury-only money market funds merit consideration, but I don’t consider them serious enough to ban lowering the target to a very low level. Excess reserves would decline, but that decline would have no negative effect on economic activity, so there should be no presumption that some other program should be expanded to restore the monetary base to its previous level. In my view, cumulative recessionary dynamics are deeply entrenched, with mounting job losses leading to weaker consumer spending, tighter credit, more job losses, and so on; and this nasty set of economic linkages is gaining momentum. Turning just very briefly to the labor market, the Beveridge curve chart that Stephanie presented during her briefing suggests that we have seen an unusually large increase in the unemployment rate recently in comparison with the decline in job openings, at least in the JOLTS data. I think one interpretation might be that the unemployment rate has risen in part because we have had an unusual rise in labor force participation during this recession. If it were to be the case, following President Lacker’s earlier question, that we suddenly saw the interest on reserves floor working better and fed funds started trading above 25—the funds rate could, for example, move up to 50 or so—I would hope that the Board would actually lower the interest rate paid on reserves to hold the funds rate in the 0 to 25 range.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Indeed, a particularly severe shortage of credit to finance international trade flows may conceivably help explain why both exports and imports are shrinking by abnormally large amounts relative to the decline in GDP. Looking ahead, I expect that, as in the Greenbook, high borrowing costs and the continuing credit crunch will help prolong the recession for at least a couple more quarters. Outside California, the data suggest that most of the country is facing near-term cuts in state spending in areas ranging from education to construction, and it appears that the fiscal stimulus will allocate money largely to those states that could most use it to avoid immediate spending cuts and finance shovel-ready infrastructure projects. I fear a cycle in which rising vacancies and falling valuations make it impossible for owners to refinance loans that will be coming due, leading to forced selling and intensifying downward price pressures. We will be analyzing these data in greater depth going forward and monitoring them, but we think they raise the risk that we could see a prolonged period in which inflation falls well below the level consistent with our dual goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The additional sentence reads, “Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.”  I would add that to B because I think it is an accurate assessment of the situation, and commenting on the risk makes our discussion of inflation comparable to our discussion of growth, where we also comment on the risks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We have a great opportunity to do it after the stress test is over, and I would push these institutions into spinning off their operations, in the cases where it is needed, into a good bank–bad bank structure. The spreads are still high, although they’ve come down, and it seems to me that the expansion of that program could have a beneficial effect on the housing market and the economy and on bringing long-term yields down more generally, since other long-term assets are substitutes for mortgage-backed securities. I thought the staff memos made a good case for the idea that the Treasuries and MBS purchases would have favorable macro effects, and I understand the concern about “what are we doing monetizing the debt?”  That’s quite a legitimate concern, but, on balance, I come out in the same place as President Stern—I don’t think we’ve lost our independence, I think people realize these are unusual and exigent circumstances, and taking a step like that now   is a favorable thing for the economy. Lenders are likely to demand more collateral for loans going forward, and that collateral has been devastated by the collapse of housing and other wealth; and households are likely to recognize the benefits of stronger balance sheets for precautionary reasons and meeting longer-term goals, such as down-payment requirements and retirement. I have heard scattered reports of such cuts, but so far the majority of my directors say they’re reluctant to cut wages for fear that it would undermine employee morale.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " On the other hand, I thought you had reported to us that the major reason that interest on reserves had failed to provide a floor for the federal funds rate—after all,   the question is why banking organizations don’t borrow at the federal funds rate and then hold them and earn a higher return by keeping it in their accounts and earning interest on reserves— was concern about leverage ratios and leverage ratios beginning to bind. What is worse, the unemployment rate appears to understate the true magnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as opposed to temporary, layoffs is high in comparison with past downturns. I expect the unemployment rate to peak at 9.6 percent late this year, a tad higher than the Greenbook, reflecting in part a somewhat more optimistic view of potential output growth compared with the Board staff’s view. Third, I am concerned that the banking system is not really strong enough to expand credit in the manner that is required for a rapid economic rebound. The problem is that the benefits of the extra capital would accrue disproportionately to debt holders and preferred shareholders, including the U.S. government, who are more senior in the capital structure. I have been struck by the resilience in wages and core inflation despite sharply declining commodity prices and a dramatic increase in slack in the labor and goods markets.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It’s a sign of how bad things really are that near euphoria broke out with the announcement of 345,000 nonfarm jobs lost in understate the true extent of the deterioration, given the unusually high incidence of permanent, as opposed to temporary, layoffs, and the unprecedented increase in involuntary part-time work. The combination of falling risk spreads on bonds, higher stock prices, higher Treasury rates, and a lower dollar seems consistent with a greater appetite for risk, probably stemming from the positive tone of emerging economic data. With foreclosures on the rise, and house prices still falling, higher borrowing costs could stall the emerging rebound in residential construction, further impairing financial institutions and markets and, thereby, hampering the recovery more broadly. I noticed that even under the typical recovery simulation, which has much stronger growth than in the baseline, the unemployment rate remains well above the 5 percent NAIRU by the end of 2011, and inflation hovers around 1 percent. So if it is included, I would prefer a more confident wording, namely, “ensuring that policy accommodation is ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.”  So I would essentially change “can be” to “is.” I also have a wording suggestion to make in paragraph 1 concerning the outlook, and my objective here, again, is to make the statement slightly less optimistic, slightly less able to be interpreted as saying that we are anywhere close to withdrawing stimulus, and, in my view, slightly more balanced.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Looking ahead, however, I foresee a slow recovery over the next several years with stubbornly high unemployment and very low price inflation, not the sharp rebound that typically follows deep recessions. In addition to factors such as continuing job losses, heightened job insecurity, tight credit conditions, and the need to rebuild lost wealth and deleverage household balance sheets, all of which are weighing on consumption, I have been struck by the recent very weak labor income growth, driven in part by stagnating nominal wages. My contacts uniformly expect commercial real estate conditions to deteriorate further, with rising foreclosures as loans come due that cannot be supported by falling rents and lower appraisals. Going forward, the pain may worsen with further revenue shortfalls and spending cutbacks acting as a drag on the whole economy. My greatest worry on the downside relates to commercial real estate and the potential for deteriorating conditions to cause many community and midsized banks to fail. On the one hand, I am worried about the increasing degree of public alarm regarding the longer-term inflation outlook, and at the same time I am worried that the intense downward wage pressure reported by my contacts could result in disinflation over the next few years that is more severe than in the Greenbook forecast. The fear of higher long-term inflation reflects to a large degree a loss of confidence that the Federal Reserve will be able to attain price stability in the face of unsustainable federal budget deficits. These inflation fears notwithstanding, the main threat to the attainment of our price stability goal over the next several years stems from the disinflationary forces that have been unleashed by the enormous slack in the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In addition to all of the risks surrounding commercial real estate, I’m concerned that some, and possibly a lot, of the improvement we’ve seen in the housing sector may result from policy supports that are about to unwind; in particular the first-time homebuyer tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of November, likely boosted activity, although perhaps at the cost of pulling demand from future quarters. In addition, even if the saving rate stabilizes and consumer spending again grows, we are not apt, given damaged household balance sheets and weak labor markets, to see the exuberant spending growth that characterized the years preceding the crisis. Finally, I foresee a jobless recovery with weak employment growth and persistently high unemployment. I believe that leaves the door slightly more open to ramping up the pace of our purchases again, if the recovery does end up suffering a significant setback and we face—Governor Tarullo, what was the name you gave the scenario?— —a relapse scenario. Specifically, I would replace the vague phase “Economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” with the alternative phrasing stating that “The Committee anticipates that low resource utilization and subdued inflation are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels….”  This language would indicate to markets that the FOMC will not raise rates merely on the basis of strong economic growth if, in fact, we are nowhere near maximum sustainable levels of employment and activity and if inflation is subdued.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I expect the economy to grow only modestly over the next couple of years, with unemployment remaining inordinately high and inflation running below my preferred rate for a very long time. A wide range of indicators shows improvement: interest rates have come down and equity prices have risen; consumer spending has picked up; home sales have risen smartly; and the global recovery has gained traction. As if the attainment of such gains weren’t enough of a challenge, we might need even larger job creation to bring the unemployment rate down under a reasonable alternative to the Greenbook’s assumption about labor force participation. Historically, however, participation has been strongly cyclical, and if over the next year the participation rate were to rebound by even half a percentage point, then we would need another 1.2 million jobs, 100,000 more per month, just to achieve the same slow decline in the unemployment rate. Of course, there are limits to the efficiency improvements that have boosted the aggregate productivity figures so spectacularly, limits to how much firms can expand production without adding employees or capital. A second principle of optimal policy under uncertainty is that policy should be formulated to guard against particularly undesirable outcomes, and this principle to my mind suggests we should stay at the zero bound for an extended period because we can easily raise rates, but it’s hard to lower them.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, these encouraging signs are marred by the persistently weak labor market and stagnating wage income. I find myself in agreement with the Greenbook’s assessment of the outlook for the economy, but this is not an outcome that I find at all satisfactory, not with unemployment rising to 10 percent this year and remaining above 8 percent through 2011 and inflation below desired levels as far as the eye can see. Because the model misses other forces that are restraining consumer spending, I haven’t adjusted my own baseline forecast up to nearly this extent, but this analysis does highlight for me a potential upside risk to the outlook similar to the V-shaped recovery discussed in the Greenbook. Interestingly, cross-country evidence reveals a remarkably strong correlation between the increase of debt to income before the crisis and the necessarily imply causation, but this evidence provides a cautionary note that we may see abnormally low consumer spending for some time. In fact, we are concerned that we now have a large number of already economically insolvent zombie banks whose troubles may have seriously impaired their ability to extend credit to the businesses in   their communities. But if we signal a tightening of policy before it is justified by the evolution of inflation and economic slack in the economy, perhaps partly out of concern that cause longer-term rates to rise, and end up in a more dangerous deflationary situation. But at this critical juncture we need to be very careful not to add to market confusion about what the main determinants will be of policy going forward, and I fear that, if we are confusing, we may hinder recovery and the attainment of price stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My main concern is that the message of liquidity normalization could be misinterpreted as a message of monetary tightening, so I think it is critical that we be clear that this is an action that is essentially a technical adjustment reflecting better market functioning. Now, I have previously argued that we should keep our options open for further purchases if the outlook worsens or if market functioning deteriorates noticeably when our purchases cease in March. While it’s heartening that inventory overhangs are no longer such a major drag on the economy, I would be more reassured if the surprise had reflected unexpected strength in final sales. Private demand seems likely to pick up as financial conditions ease further with higher equity prices, narrower risk spreads, and improved bank credit supply. Post-recession booms commonly reflect a spurt of pent-up demand, and we could see such a snapback if, for example, households and businesses postponed spending during the period of greatest economic uncertainty and now feel more secure and ready to open their wallets. Also, the fallout on households from foreclosures could be more severe than I anticipate. The Greenbook assumes that extended unemployment benefits are temporarily boosting the effective NAIRU to 6¼ percent, and certainly a higher NAIRU could be part of the story. Essentially, I see a rise in the effective level of potential output as at least as important a factor in reconciling Okun’s law as a rise in the effective NAIRU.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I am worried about introducing a facility that’s geared solely to overcoming legislative restrictions on the GSEs’ ability to earn interest, and I share the concern that, by expanding to such a great extent trading reserves outside the brokered fed funds market, we can end up undermining the functioning of the brokered fed funds market. The boost from the inventory cycle appears largely over, and the growth contribution from fiscal stimulus is waning, but improvements in exports, consumer spending, and business investment should support moderate real GDP growth this year. Given the extraordinary depth of the recession, I expect it will be a very long time before the economy returns to its potential, and my own economic growth forecast exceeds the pace my business contacts consider plausible in light of the pervasive caution about spending that they see among their customers and business associates. The latest labor market reports have been a bit more favorable than expected, especially given the unseasonably bad weather; but even so, as I stressed at the January meeting, labor market readings paint an even bleaker picture of underutilization than product-side measures. I, therefore, anticipate that the share of loans that is seriously delinquent will keep moving higher, generating further increases in the pace of foreclosures. Furthermore, I believe that the risks associated with tightening prematurely still exceed those resulting from tightening too late. At this point in the cycle, with exceptionally high unemployment and very low inflation, I believe our policy actions should focus squarely on our mandate for price stability and full employment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nonetheless, I do recognize the concerns around this table about our balance sheet, and for that reason, I’m open to strategies involving asset sales and Treasury redemptions to shrink our balance sheet more rapidly than the staff’s option 1 and to shift its composition more quickly toward Treasuries if we can do that without having a significant negative impact on macro performance. By initiating policy tightening through asset sales rather than an increase in the IOER rate, option 3 brings down our MBS portfolio more rapidly. First of all, logically, a decision to sell off assets before we raise the IOER rate implies an even longer period of exceptionally low rates and a more gradual pace of tightening once the IOER rate is raised than markets now anticipate. With respect to interest rates, there’s a long track record upon which the public can base expectations, but for asset sales we have no such track record, and fear that such an approach would create greater market volatility and uncertainty as markets react—and almost invariably overreact—to every word we say. Although my banker contacts adamantly deny they are tightening standards per se, they admit they are scrutinizing loans more closely and refusing to make exceptions to their standards, which effectively makes it harder for businesses to get loans. In my view, the risks associated with tightening policy prematurely far exceed any risks from tightening policy too late.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Economic data releases since our April meeting have been consistent with the moderate recovery, but the turmoil in Europe with resulting deterioration in financial conditions during the intermeeting period pose substantial risks to economic growth and global financial stability going forward. As Bill Wascher emphasized, long-term unemployment has now risen from its pre-recession level of about 1 percent to over 4 percent, and, as of May, 46 percent of the unemployed had been without a job for at least 27 weeks. Another risk that concerns me, albeit a far less dramatic one, is that the underlying trend in productivity growth forecast assumes that labor productivity growth will slow sharply from its recent rapid pace to a little above 1 percent this year and next. This is well below the Board staff’s estimate of structural productivity growth of 2 percent, and it reflects some payback from the extraordinary productivity gains of 2009 and early this year resulting from the reversal of strains on workers—strains that will not prove sustainable. At this point, I see the risks associated with tightening policy prematurely as extremely high, owing to the zero bound on interest rates and the fact that inflation is already so low. It remains to my mind unclear just how important low short-term rates, as opposed to other factors, were in sowing the seeds of the financial crisis; but recognizing and evaluating financial risks and vulnerabilities should be at the center of our efforts to ramp up macro prudential surveillance.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My own view is that a double-dip recession with negative GDP growth is very unlikely. To me, a more relevant benchmark is whether growth during the next few quarters will fall below potential. A self-sustaining recovery crucially depends on the private sector stepping up as the impetus to growth from the fiscal stimulus and inventory dynamics ends. Nonetheless, that stimulus may ultimately prove insufficient to overcome a daunting list of headwinds, including tight credit, impaired household balance sheets, a housing overhang, state and local budget crises, and heightened uncertainty. A number of people around the table this morning have commented on this heightened uncertainty, and it is a factor slowing the recovery that many of my own business contacts also constantly stress. This logic is leading many of my business contacts to postpone new projects, to defer hiring, and to build up cash reserves. I worry that growth below potential and a deteriorating jobs outlook could trigger adverse feedbacks on consumer and business confidence, further stunting the economy’s forward momentum. Given the tenuous state of business and consumer confidence, I consider it critical at this juncture that this Committee not be perceived as falling behind the curve, being unwilling to act, or being out of touch with the mounting concerns we see in the markets and on Main Street. I think we should also be considering the options available for further accommodation, and I would be strongly inclined in that direction if the forecast is downgraded to the point where we project that unemployment will be edging up rather than down.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The central tendency of our April projections, for example, showed a persistent failure to achieve anything close to our dual mandate. Unfortunately, the disappointing news this summer—lackluster employment, deteriorating sentiment, anemic retail sales, decelerating investment, and further price disinflation—has pushed the attainment of our policy objectives off even further into the future. Of course, a negative shock to aggregate supply is also partly to blame, and we could improve our failing grade on our full employment mandate by grading on a curve, that is, by substantially raising the NAIRU. Ultimately, then, it’s an empirical task to figure out how much of the recent movements in the Beveridge curve reflect cyclical factors related to the weak economy and weak aggregate demand and how much reflects more permanent changes affecting the NAIRU. My contacts confirm the conclusion that mismatch is a problem only for small, specialized jobs, and, without exception, they report that it is now easier to identify applicants for such specialized skilled jobs than before the recession. We see many more applicants now who are overqualified relative to job requirements.”  Indeed, with an abundance of qualified applicants and a lack of sales, firms may well see some option value in holding vacancies open longer as they search for the really exceptional candidate. Indeed, by most measures, inflation expectations are lower today than they were in the spring:  Surveys of inflation expectations are lower, and inflation compensation from TIPS is lower; even the number of searches on Google for the term “inflation” has been trending down for months.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I personally see them as damaging our credibility and our reputation at a time when the institution is under enormous scrutiny, and we can ill afford it. But, frankly, I think many of the comments we’ve made are destructive of collegiality and of the Committee process—they do come close to feeling like a situation where we walk into the room having said, in effect, that it doesn’t matter what arguments or evidence one of us around the table musters, because our minds are made up. One way to strengthen the voice of the Committee that we’ve discussed a bit would be for the Chairman to speak about policy more frequently and, perhaps, at critical moments, such    as when we’ve made key policy decisions. But I remain concerned that the process of balance sheet repair in the aftermath of the financial crisis could involve more significant deleveraging by households and a rise in the personal saving rate above the Tealbook baseline, resulting in outcomes like the weaker recovery alternative in the Tealbook. The bottom line is that further deleveraging poses a real risk to the expansion, and this risk is exacerbated by very low inflation. By now, there appears to be considerable pent-up demand for autos and other consumer durables, which could trigger more rapid growth in spending if the job market improves and uncertainty about future income abates, similar to the stronger recovery scenario.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Consumer spending is hardly exuberant, but purchases of durable goods, a typical driver of recovery in the early stages of expansion, have picked up some steam, and I consider that encouraging. Of course, the performance of the labor market is critical to consumer spending going forward, and it is disappointing that unemployment ticked up during the intermeeting period. It should boost growth somewhat during the coming year and diminish the risk that fiscal drag could tip the economy back into recession. Moreover, incoming data suggest that house prices remain under continued downward pressure due to the bloated supply of new and existing homes for sale, plus the huge shadow inventory reflecting foreclosures and seriously delinquent mortgages. Such a large decline in house prices will also significantly increase the already large fraction of homes that are underwater on their mortgages, likely precipitating additional foreclosures and re-defaults on modified loans. Fiscal contraction on the scale needed would severely undermine their prospects for economic growth. Moreover, restoration of growth seems likely to require wage cuts to restore competitiveness, and such cuts, if they occur, would make the burden of the debt yet more onerous. The evidence suggests that criticisms of the program and the ensuing political backlash contributed to this adverse market reaction and, at the same time, raised the degree of uncertainty concerning longer-term rates and Fed policy. Higher risk premiums due to increased uncertainty may also be pushing up yields.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But these positives were offset by developments since November, suggesting a deeper and more persistent housing downturn and steeper declines in house prices than I previously anticipated. The large overhang of existing homes for sale, the bulging foreclosure pipeline, the inability of homeowners with negative equity to trade up, and continuing tight lending standards are depressing house prices throughout the country. The decline in labor force participation, very modest gains in wages and compensation, and continuing perceptions in surveys that jobs are exceptionally difficult to obtain, all suggest that the labor market remains quite weak. I interpret the quit rate—the fraction of employed workers who voluntarily resign their jobs to search, exit the labor force, or take another job immediately—as a good measure of fear and perceived opportunity. The quit rate is now above the lows reached in the depth of the recession, but I take the very modest increase as a signal that improvement in the labor market is, thus far, quite modest. He asked us first to assure appropriate treatment of confidential FOMC information, including our contacts with the press; second, we were to develop policies to avoid the perception that individuals outside of the Federal Reserve System are able to gain inappropriate access to FOMC information that could be valuable in forecasting monetary policy; and, third, we were to develop policies to ensure that the public communications of FOMC participants do not undermine the Committee’s decisionmaking process or the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Even so, there are ongoing drags from housing, nonresidential construction, and state and local government spending, along with new downside risks relating to possible near-term federal spending cuts and the negative spillovers from higher gas and commodity prices, and broader uncertainties relating to the Middle East, North Africa, Japan, and the euro area. These risks to the recovery have grown in recent weeks, and they diminish my confidence that we will enjoy smooth sailing ahead. With respect to private spending, I am encouraged that business surveys and anecdotal reports have taken on a more optimistic tone. The stock market has recovered, labor market conditions have improved somewhat, those with jobs have less reason to fear losing them, and the burden of debt payments has abated to more normal levels. For example, even though employment has expanded in both the household and payroll surveys, overall job gains since employment stopped falling have been modest, and the gains since there is no evidence of a rebound in labor force participation—something I would expect to see during a recovery. Hours have also been flat, and this leaves me wondering whether a portion of the recent decline in unemployment may reflect a shift of discouraged workers from the     unemployment pool to those counted as out of the labor force. For example, about 3.8 million workers lost their jobs between November 2008 and March 2009, and those who are still unemployed would have exhausted extended unemployment benefits in recent months.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " [Laughter]  The good news is, we have a brilliant and highly experienced pilot, and all of us trust him to accomplish a safe landing. Second, the Federal Reserve is also responsible to contribute to the effective and efficient functioning of financial markets, so we should avoid needless disruption. Therefore, I am not certain there is any particular advantage in waiting to drop the “extended period” language. I may be wrong to worry about this link between IOER and the federal funds rate, but, like President Evans, I do have some concerns about how tight that link will be. An armada of headwinds is constraining the recovery:  higher food and energy prices, falling housing prices, ongoing weakness in residential and nonresidential construction, intense pressures on state and local government spending, and, beginning next year, significant fiscal drag from the federal budget. I expect the output gap and unemployment to decline, but slowly, so both will be substantially higher than normal levels at the end of the forecast horizon. Meaningful efforts to cut the federal budget deficit could produce a significant and extended drag on economic growth in the years ahead. Failure to enact such a package would threaten our financial stability, while an extended period of delay would be associated with elevated uncertainty that could start weighing heavily on the spending decisions of households and businesses. The unemployment rate remains well above its longer-run sustainable rate, and, as I noted in the economic go-round, this gap mainly reflects a shortfall in aggregate demand rather than structural factors.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " With stable longer-term inflation expectations, minimal cost pressure from wages, moderate productivity gains, and a higher projected path for unemployment, I anticipate, in line with the Tealbook, that inflation over the forecast period horizon will decline below the 2 percent level I consider most consistent with our dual mandate. These revisions reflect the broad-based character of the recent weakness and my growing concern that business confidence is eroding, causing firms to put plans for capital projects and hiring on hold—a response I see as exacerbating the slowdown and creating the potential for a self-fulfilling negative feedback loop to develop, a phenomenon that could cause the recovery to stall. The two words that crop up continually are “uncertainty” and “caution.”  Survey measures of business confidence have about the strength and the durability of the recovery, along with myriad other worries including concerns about ongoing sovereign debt issues in Europe and the United States, uncertainty about fiscal and regulatory policy, and anxiety about geopolitical risks in the Middle East and North Africa. In this regard, an interesting Tealbook box documents that uncertainty, while below the highs achieved during the financial crisis, is now abnormally high. It is premised on the assumption that a revival in auto production and sales next quarter, coupled with diminishing drag from food and energy prices, will cause economic activity to rebound in coming quarters, in turn diminishing business uncertainty, improving confidence, and setting the stage for moderate economic growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I’ve marked down my economic growth outlook substantially in light of the information received over recent weeks, and I’ve become increasingly concerned about the downside risks. Energy price increases also depressed spending in the first half of the year, but careful staff analysis suggests that the decline in real disposable income resulting from higher energy prices can explain only a portion of the negative consumption surprise. For     example, the recession probabilities that David Wilcox presented in his briefing were derived from a Markov regime-switching model in which the economy periodically transitions between three possible states:  an expansion state, with normal GDP growth; a recession state, with negative GDP growth; and a stall-speed state, in which GDP growth is positive but well below normal. However, the model is blissfully unaware of other significant risks, such as the S&P rating downgrade, the weakness of the housing sector, and the serious challenges facing our European counterparts. Even though transitory factors played a role in depressing growth during the first half of the year, the data we have received since June revealed broad-based weakness that is very likely to persist. The argument for policy easing becomes yet stronger when we consider the balance of risks to economic activity and inflation. The downside risk to growth is particularly serious now because the potential for fiscal policy to respond in the event of a downturn is limited, if not nonexistent.\n",

      " Under the modal outlook, the program would have only negligible effects on the present value of our transfers to the U.S. Treasury, and under an alternative adverse scenario like that shown in the staff memo, the implied cost per job appears to still be under around $200,000, which seems quite low compared with many other proposals for stimulating employment. I’m concerned about the increasing volume of negative commentary that the $4 billion per year we’re paying on reserves when prevailing money market rates are lower constitutes an unwarranted subsidy to banks. with the aim of attaining an appropriate     balance between stabilising inflation around the inflation target and stabilising the real economy.”  The Riksbank regularly publishes its estimates of the longer-run sustainable rates of output growth and unemployment, and its Monetary Policy Reports show how actual output and unemployment are expected to converge over time to those longer-term sustainable paths. Under a modal outlook like that of the staff, in which unemployment is declining only gradually and inflation remains below 2 percent, it seems reasonable that we would keep the funds rate targeted at its current setting until the unemployment rate drops below 7 percent. I can’t see how such a forecast can be consistent with optimal policy under an inflation-targeting strategy if we interpret that as a forward-looking approach in which we choose policy to minimize a loss function, including deviations of inflation from target and deviations of unemployment from its long-run equilibrium level.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " By 2024, the economy is in mild recession with unemployment rising back up to 6 percent and inflation running around 1¼ for a few years until the path finally settles down around 2030. The funding pressures currently afflicting European banks have already caused them to restrict credit and to delever, and these pressures may intensify as growth slows, as European banks experience pressures on their earnings and higher losses on their nonsovereign assets, and as banks struggle to meet the higher capital standards called for by European leaders and banking authorities. And finally, with respect to European politics, as the European leaders’ statement emphasized, progress on fiscal integration in Europe is necessary to the success of the euro, but exceptionally difficult politically. Under current policy settings, the Tealbook forecast and the Committee’s central tendency projections show unemployment remaining exceptionally high for years to come and inflation running below the 2 percent level that most Committee members consider consistent with our dual mandate. In my view, it would be feasible to foster a more satisfactory recovery, without pushing inflation above 2½ percent, by using communication strategies like those illustrated in alternative A1—namely, strategies that would convey the Committee’s intention to exit from the zero lower bound at a somewhat later date, and to firm policy at a somewhat more gradual pace, than financial markets currently anticipate. I also hope we’ll be able to move forward with incorporating policy projections into the SEP.  As a matter of fact, I became even more persuaded of the merits of publishing our funds rate projections as I filled out my survey for this round and discovered that my rosy economic forecasts could easily be misinterpreted in the absence of information on my judgment about appropriate policy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Indeed, the numbers of individuals receiving food stamps has risen month after month and is now more than 30 percent higher than in June 2009 when the NBER officially declared that the recession was over. In effect, under current policy settings, the U.S. economy continues to face an exceptionally prolonged period of unacceptably high unemployment and a duration of unemployment spells that is simply unprecedented. The longer this situation persists, the more likely it is that individuals who are unable to obtain work will be permanently scarred—a development that is not only tragic for them and their families, but will also lower the potential of our economy. While there are certainly some upside risks to the Tealbook’s outlook for a very slow recovery, it is evidently quite hard to identify any scenario under current monetary policy in which growth would be sufficiently robust to bring unemployment down to normal levels within the next several years. Most notably, while the Europeans may have made some progress in cementing stronger long-run fiscal discipline, they have done little to address the deterioration in the European economic outlook or to resolve the uncertainties that have caused market participants to shed sovereign debt and lose confidence in European banking institutions. At the same time unemployment is forecast to fall far short of its maximum sustainable level and inflation now appears likely to drift substantially below the 2 percent level most of us consider consistent with the Fed’s dual mandate.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " With fiscal policy set to impose increasing drag over the forecast horizon and a considerably weaker outlook for global growth, I have been unable to identify any plausible scenario in which growth in employment turns out to be much stronger than the Tealbook baseline. I’m also concerned that the progress in lowering unemployment in the Tealbook baseline rests partly on the assumption that a considerable                                            portion of the decline in labor force participation we’ve seen in the last several years has been secular rather than cyclical, and therefore unlikely to be reversed as the recovery strengthens. In contrast, labor force participation among those over 55 has increased considerably, and several studies and recent articles in the press have highlighted the frequency with which older workers are moving back into the workforce because, with declining stock and house prices and a weak economy, they have insufficient retirement reserves. If this pattern holds up, the rather weak employment growth in the staff baseline could prove insufficient to reduce unemployment by even the modest amount that the staff projects. Holding the funds rate at zero until the unemployment rate has declined below 7 percent, under the assumption that inflation remains under or near our 2 percent target, is, as I mentioned, a strategy I judge appropriate in light of policy rules, optimal policy simulations, and research concerning the appropriate response of monetary policy to the constraints posed by the zero lower bound.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, the highest proportion of consumers in the history of the Michigan survey spontaneously reported hearing about recent employment gains, and a larger number of consumers expect declines in the jobless rate than at any time since 2004. For example, the quit rate, a reflection of workers’ willingness and ability to change jobs, while up from the trough reached in only slightly, and the duration of unemployment spells remains exceptionally long. According to staff estimates, 0.8 percentage point of the decline in unemployment can be attributed to this productivity slowdown, which the staff interprets as an unwinding by firms of unsustainably low labor input following the very aggressive job cuts during the financial crisis. For example, in the latest Blue Chip survey that was published last Friday, the consensus outlook is for real GDP growth to hover around 2½ to 3 percent over the next few years and for the unemployment rate to decline only gradually to 7.2 percent in 2014 and to finally drop below 6 percent in 2018. That said, unemployment is still elevated, and if the staff is right, absent some unanticipated pickup in spending, further declines in unemployment over the next two years will be modest at best. Consequently, I’m concerned that we could be misled yet again by hopeful signs early in the year followed by tepid growth later, and that a premature move toward policy firming could end up driving inflation further below our objective and retard what is already a long-delayed return to maximum employment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In gauging nationwide trends over the past decade, however, the Zillow index shows a less dramatic boom and bust than either Case-Shiller or CoreLogic because the Zillow index incorporates more information about smaller markets outside the large coastal metropolitan areas that typified the housing boom. Again, in the Zillow data there is improvement in that in 2011, the national house-price index fell 5 percent, and in the first quarter it’s fallen at a 2 percent annual rate, so that does show an improvement. Even taking such uncertainty into account, I see the odds as very high that unemployment will exceed its normal longer-run rate at the end of 2014. Inflation remains close to 2 percent throughout the forecast period, peaking at 2.3 percent, and unemployment declines notably more quickly than under Taylor (1999), reaching its normal longer-run level in 2016. The problem is that the loss function embodied in the simulation treats an undershoot of the unemployment goal as welfare detracting, a view that is inconsistent with many theoretical models of an economy dominated by monopolistically competitive firms. I also share the concern discussed yesterday by Governor Tarullo that if a return to full employment is too prolonged, we risk higher structural unemployment as a consequence, or hysteresis. Even with symmetric risks, the seriousness of the resulting economic losses and the greater difficulty in responding should downside risks materialize create an intrinsic motive for additional policy accommodation now.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A more fundamental limitation of the SEP is that it is simply a survey of individual views and, hence, it is not necessarily very effective in conveying the rationale for the Committee’s collective                                                   Under the Chairman’s leadership, we arrive at our policy judgments through a consensus-building process that truly can’t be well captured by any mechanical procedure for aggregating our individual assessments. In addition to disappointing readings on retail spending and labor market conditions, and the slowdown in global economic growth, there has also been a significant tightening of domestic financial conditions, including lower equity prices, higher risk spreads, and a stronger dollar. Both my forecast and my judgment concerning appropriate monetary policy are shaped by my view that the restraints on aggregate demand due to the housing bust, ongoing fiscal drag, slower global economic growth, and ongoing financial market stress will not dissipate over the next several years. In the absence of this barrier, nominal gains in wages and unit labor costs would have likely been even more subdued given the severity of the economic downturn, with the result that inflation would probably now be running at a yet lower rate. Importantly, downward nominal wage rigidity is completely consistent with the view that today’s high unemployment reflects labor market slack due to a shortfall of aggregate demand and not an increase in structural unemployment. With respect to policy, I agree with the Tealbook’s reading of the data that, absent further monetary policy accommodation, economic growth is likely to be insufficient to achieve any meaningful progress in lowering unemployment.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Nonetheless, in response to incoming data on broader economic activity, I have slightly marked down my projection for GDP growth this year, and I have become even more pessimistic that we will see sustained progress in the labor market. For example, Zillow data reveal that within the Phoenix metropolitan area, the largest decline in inventories has occurred in the lowest priced tier of homes, and price increases in this tier have been largest. Moreover, the analysis I just described suggests that house price increases may be disproportionately large in precisely those areas where negative equity is most prevalent. In particular, I expect that well-anchored inflation expectations, continuing downward pressure from high unemployment on wage growth, and moderate increases in import prices will keep inflation running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective. My modal outlook, conditional on policy consistent with our June statement, involves moderate growth and excruciatingly slow progress in lowering unemployment toward normal levels. Doing so should provide additional support to the housing sector, even though those effects may be attenuated given the impediments in the mortgage I recognize, and agree with President Fisher, that lower borrowing costs may have only a minimal effect on investment spending, precisely for the reasons that you’ve given—that businesses at this point are preoccupied with uncertainty, weak demand, and excess capacity and don’t see their inability to borrow on reasonable terms as an impediment to hiring or spending.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " They show that increases in economic policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in output, employment, and investment, and that high levels of policy uncertainty in recent years, such as uncertainty about future tax policies and the debt ceiling, have hampered the recovery. We face the worrisome risk that the longer the economy operates with such high levels of slack, the more likely it is that the downturn will have a lasting negative impact on employment and potential output. Taking this argument one step further, I would argue that just as there can be permanent costs of allowing unemployment to remain high for an extensive time, there can also be permanent gains in output and employment in a high-pressure labor market. But with hysteresis, the penalty for a deviation of unemployment above the NAIRU should be greater than that for an identical deviation of unemployment below the NAIRU. Bob Tetlow, a staff member in the Board’s Division of Research and Statistics, has been exploring optimal control simulations where the loss function depends on the squared deviations of a transformation of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU, rather than on the squared deviations of the unemployment rate itself from the NAIRU. Whereas our previous language tied exceptionally low levels of                                            the funds rate to economic weakness, the new language incorporated into the beginning of B(5) is much more positive, and I think it’s a very significant improvement.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Second, spelling out explicit thresholds for action is a way for us to communicate a commitment to keep rates lower for longer, and it provides the public with a way to monitor whether or not we’re actually sticking to that commitment as the recovery proceeds and unemployment declines toward more normal levels. I                                              believe it is quite important under current conditions for us to keep rates low for a longer time than implied by policy rules developed during more normal periods, and I’m pleased that that we do plan to stay lower for longer. But for now, let me just say that I view the unemployment rate as                                              the best and most appropriate variable for providing a threshold for the employment side of our dual mandate, and concerning inflation, I prefer projected to actual inflation, given the volatility of PCE inflation. More households expect good economic conditions over the next year and the next five years, and more anticipate that the national unemployment rate will move down. Some of the decline may conceivably reflect statistical noise, but the fact that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the Gallup poll also declined by a similar amount between mid-September and mid-October supports the view that there is signal in this decline. That decline was certainly unwelcome, most likely reflecting flight to safety and heightened concerns about negative tail risks. As I discussed during the economic go-round, despite some encouraging signals from the household sector and the recent decline in the unemployment rate, I have seen no evidence of any substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market or any fundamental strengthening in economic conditions.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rate has declined more than I had anticipated, but as the staff memo on assessing conditions in the labor market emphasizes, even absent the distortions from hurricane effects, changes in the unemployment rate are best interpreted in light of a number of other measures. The decline in the participation rate, on the other hand, raises a question of whether the step-down in the unemployment rate actually reflects progress in reducing slack or, instead, signifies that the natural rate of unemployment is falling as discouraged workers, including those completing extended unemployment benefits, leave the labor force. With respect to costs of our asset purchases, I worry most that a prolonged environment of low interest rates and the yield curve we are intentionally flattening through our purchases careful efforts of our staff to monitor such threats to financial stability. I recognize that market expectations concerning the ultimate level of purchases under this program exceed the comfort levels of some members of the Committee, but I am very concerned that a reduction in the pace of purchases at this critical juncture would undermine what we are trying to accomplish and could have a very destabilizing effect. We also face the serious risk that inflation, which we currently forecast to run below our target, could decline further over time, raising real interest rates and thereby making it yet more difficult for monetary policy to provide meaningful stimulus. Frankly, I worried at the time of our September meeting that our open-ended purchase program would be interpreted by purchases to significant improvements in the outlook for the labor market, and coupling this                                                   commitment with the statement that we intend to keep rates low as the economic recovery strengthens, we communicated that we will at least keep refilling the punch bowl until the guests have all arrived, and will not remove it prematurely before the party is well under way.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Here at home, some fiscal risks remain, but at least it now seems less likely that the debt ceiling will be breached, and the uncertainty about tax policy that has weighed on business this reason, I’m a bit more optimistic than the Tealbook on investment spending. House prices and starts have both surprised to the upside; the rental market is going strong; household formations have increased; and a combination of rising rents, exceptional affordability due to low house prices and mortgage rates, and growing confidence among homeowners that prices are unlikely to move lower in most markets could precipitate a faster rebound in residential investment than is incorporated in the Tealbook baseline. In response to past such deviations from Okun’s law, the Tealbook scaled back its estimates of the level of potential output, but a key question is whether the pace of structural productivity growth has fallen persistently in the wake of the recession. Of course, there are also risks that unemployment will decline yet more slowly than the Tealbook forecasts if a stronger job on the likely pace of improvement of the labor market, but I’ll be closely watching in the months ahead developments that shed light on both productivity growth and participation. In paragraph 2, I do very much like the shift from the negative rationale for our purchases—namely, that without them, economic growth might not be strong enough to see improvement in the labor market—to the more positive rationale that with the program we do expect to see gradual improvement.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In that regard, I am concerned that recent employment gains owe more to weak productivity growth than to strong output growth—a pattern, as in the past, suggesting that they a pickup in productivity growth toward trend, and marginal further improvements in the labor We will discuss the efficacy and costs of asset purchases later this afternoon and our policy options tomorrow, but for me the bottom line is that, while there has been some improvement in the labor market, I don’t yet see any substantial improvement in the outlook that would now warrant curtailing our purchase program. Of course, my forecast is shrouded in uncertainty, and my assessment might change if, as I hope, the next several months bring continued strong employment gains, further declines in the unemployment rate, and good news pertaining to the overall outlook for growth. Turning to the specific questions, the staff discussion of efficacy and a range of observations leaves me convinced that our asset purchases are serving to lower unemployment and prevent inflation from declining more substantially below target. A higher interest rate environment might diminish the incentive of investors to reach for yield, but it’s a blunt and potentially counterproductive tool,     even for financial stability purposes, because higher rates would impair economic performance, creating different, but no less consequential, financial risks. Contrary to our forward guidance, it could also bring forward the date at which up sharply if growth unexpectedly strengthens, but, in this case, the associated improvement in economic prospects should boost borrower quality, strengthen financial institutions, and raise expected investment returns, serving, in effect, as an automatic stabilizer.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The establishment survey suggested widespread weakness in payroll employment growth, and analysts noted that the two-tenths percentage point decline in the labor force participation rate more than accounted for the one-tenth of a percentage point decline in the unemployment rate. The sizable step-down in part-time employment, coupled with the decline in the numbers of discouraged and marginally attached workers in March, suggests to me that despite weak payroll employment growth, there may actually have been some further improvement in the labor market. Importantly, this participation gap is the largest estimated cyclical shortfall since the 1960s, exceeding the estimated shortfall in the deep recession of 1981–82 and during the jobless recovery following the 2001 recession. Of course, if the actual pace of trend decline in labor force participation is much smaller than the                                                Tealbook assumes, this might also call into question the plausibility of my more optimistic interpretation of last month’s employment report. With policy constrained by the zero lower bound, however, the costs from inadvertently reducing accommodation due to an overestimate of the natural rate greatly outweigh those from policy errors reflecting an overly optimistic natural-rate estimate. The illustrative statement language that the staff prepared for the “Modest growth” scenario demonstrates, in my view, just how difficult it will be to explain why we decided to begin winding down our asset purchases despite lack of progress on labor market improvements and for reasons we did not already know at the time we started the program.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As actual output growth    outstrips potential, I anticipate further declines in the unemployment rate and a gradual rise in inflation back toward our 2 percent objective. I see the magnitude of downside risks as lower now than late last summer when European financial markets seemed closer to a meltdown, but I continue to see the risks as weighted to the downside. TIPS-based five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation is down 35 basis points since the April meeting, and the Cleveland Fed’s measure of expected inflation has fallen below 1½ percent, down from 2 percent a couple of years ago. The risk that we will be disappointed yet again is considerable, given that, as Tealbook notes, much of the projected acceleration in real activity rests on the emergence of a mutually reinforcing dynamic of increased confidence, virtuous circle that is hardly guaranteed to emerge and that could easily be derailed by an adverse shock. Aggregate hours have grown more rapidly, and the level of payroll employment is substantially higher, although we need to be careful not to overstate the degree to which the level of employment has improved since September, as some of the surprise reflects benchmark revisions to the historical data. I anticipate moderate gains in payroll employment in the coming months, with the unemployment rate falling a bit more by the end of the year, but only if GDP growth actually accelerates, as I and the Tealbook forecast.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But broader measures of underutilization, including discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons, rose sharply, reversing all of the declines seen earlier this year. The downward revision to first-half output growth, combined with relatively strong employment gains, implies that labor productivity growth was actually negative during the first half of the year, running far below even the most pessimistic estimates of structural productivity growth in the wake of the recession and its aftermath. This increases my confidence that the recovery, thanks in part to our policies, is successfully weathering the worst phase of fiscal drag, and that substantial underlying momentum in private spending will start showing through to economic growth as the year progresses. Even setting aside the risk of such a bad scenario, continuing misses on our inflation objective to the downside imply higher real interest rates, which serve to restrain economic activity and make it even harder for stretched borrowers to reduce their real debt burdens. I could continue to elaborate on further downside risks such as those pertaining to global growth and the impending debt ceiling, but I don’t mean to deny that there’s a decent chance that with fading fiscal drag, the recovery will finally pull out of Governor Tarullo’s mud, and I will reach Kansas City in reasonable time. I would want to avoid any alterations that might work to increase    uncertainty or confusion about our reaction function or raise any questions about our commitment that the threshold language entails about our intention to, in essence, hold the funds rate lower for longer.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I was pleasantly surprised by the sizable further decline in the unemployment rate, but, as others have noted, several weak spots lurked beneath the surface of the past two employment reports. In particular, the slowing pace of payroll gains suggests that productivity growth may finally be picking up. If so, job growth may well continue to move down in coming quarters, rather than reverting to the near 200,000 per month pace we enjoyed earlier this year, unless output growth strengthens substantially. Mortgage rates have risen yet further since our July meeting, and it seems increasingly likely that the soft tone in housing starts and home sales, as well as the apparent slowing in the pace of house price gains, may reflect restraint from those higher rates. Lesson two is that the economy is able to attain full employment during a period in which r* is still severely depressed only because monetary policy takes this fact into consideration both before and after liftoff of the funds rate from the zero bound. Now, by the end of 2016, by having a low value of the real funds rate— it is exactly what Narayana said—the headwinds are still there, but by keeping the real federal funds rate well below its long-run level of 2 percent, we succeed in combating them and achieving our goals. But as I explained yesterday, against that assessment of the extent of progress we’ve achieved stand my lingering doubts about the potential for further improvements going forward.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Given the noise that the government shutdown will introduce into the next employment report, it may be some time before we get a clearer read on whether the slowing we are seeing in the pace of labor market improvement is just a temporary step down along a path that will eventually exhibit greater momentum, as in the Tealbook baseline, or whether the data instead portend a more lasting shift to a scenario of slower progress. In scenario 3, we are already at the new normal as far as economic growth is concerned because structural damage to the economy from the recession and the financial crisis exceeds that in the baseline. To be sure, I’m quite uncertain about this outlook, as it reflects more a tendency to draw inferences from past forecast errors than any clearly articulated view of exactly why aggregate demand is picking up so slowly. The labor market would continue to improve even though growth may not pick up, but we can taper asset purchases as we see that progress, and if unemployment declines quickly, it would likely also be appropriate to remove accommodation sooner than in the baseline. We have discussed the uncertain costs and risks associated with a very large balance sheet and stopping around that time the outlook is uncertain, and we need to be mindful that a scenario could unfold along the lines I discussed yesterday:  a scenario where economic growth does not pick up, progress in the labor could also mount.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But most labor market indicators, including the pace of payroll gains, the fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons, the incidence of long-term unemployment, the level of UI claims, and the pace of hiring and quits, show continued, albeit gradual, improvement. The decline in the unemployment rate since the inception of the program signals, to my mind, more dramatic progress, but a portion reflects a continuing decline in labor force                                            participation that in my assessment may well be partly cyclical. But the staff had been warning that job gains of this magnitude could only persist if growth were to pick up above the 2 percent trendlike pace we have been experiencing. This suggests to me that further progress in the labor market may well be achievable, even absent a pickup in growth, although a worrisome implication is that this pattern may reflect a more persistent decline in structural productivity growth. The 0.8 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate this year, coupled with monthly job gains in the range of 175,000 to 200,000 and real GDP projected to expand just 2¼ percent, may well indicate a more lasting also be a harbinger of greater supply-side damage. And under that same outlook, one that’s characterized by only slowly lifting headwinds, I consider it appropriate to defer liftoff until late 2015 when the unemployment rate has declined to, or is slightly below, 6 percent.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The household survey was more mixed, and I see the main question there as whether to interpret the large decline in the unemployment rate as signaling an equally large reduction in the degree of labor market slack. This assessment is made more difficult by the accompanying 0.2 percentage point decline in labor force participation. We’ve debated any number of times over the past year or so whether labor market slack is now becoming increasingly manifest in lower labor force participation rather than in measured unemployment, and there are arguments on both sides of this debate. But we are confronting a difficult identification problem, because these demographic changes coincide with the aftermath of a particularly deep recession. It’s conceivable that the demographic changes imply a steeper decline in the trend rate of labor force participation than the 0.3 percentage point per year assumed in the Tealbook baseline, but I remain reasonably optimistic that a substantial fraction of the decline in participation among younger cohorts would be reversed in a strong economy with a higher pressure job market. While I’m inclined to discount at least a portion of the large decline in the unemployment rate in December, it does seem fair to conclude that the drop signals at least some reduction in slack. I agree with all of you who have urged that we need to think very hard about how to change the guidance quickly and that we need to be well positioned for either scenario, whether the data end up being disappointing and weaker than we have anticipated or stronger than we have anticipated.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " [Laughter]  I fully expected somebody to argue that, because the short-term unemployment rate had declined so much, that was suggesting slack in the labor market has diminished. You can’t talk to businesses without hearing about the difficulty of hiring certain kinds of labor, and that may have increased somewhat, but that’s probably not a sign the labor On the second question of whether incoming data on spending and productivity indicate enough strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market, basically, what I heard in the discussion is that the answer to that question is “yes.”  Obviously, there’s a lot of uncertainty thrown into this assessment by the severe winter weather and by the fact that, in a sense, we got head-faked in January and substantially revised up our outlook. We do say in our statement that we wouldn’t want to see it run persistently below our objective, and that that would create risks, including rising real interest rates, that would impede recovery. I’d summarize by saying that most of you seem to see improvement in labor markets with enough momentum to support ongoing improvement over time; and inflation that’s low and no firm evidence—but a reasonable presumption—that the forces are there to raise it over time. The Tealbook has once again revised down potential GDP growth to better reconcile the observed decline in the unemployment rate with GDP growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " On the question of labor market improvement, I heard general agreement around the table that the labor market is continuing to improve, and that spending is most likely strong enough to see continued gradual improvement, although certainly a number of people—President Lockhart, Vice Chairman Dudley, President Evans, and Governor Tarullo—all suggested that the jury actually remains out at this point about just how large a pickup we’re likely to see in economic growth. I think the story here is that nominal wage growth may be currently held down by the fact that while some firms during the downturn cut wages, many were either unwilling or unable to cut wages as much as they would have liked. That may, on the one hand, explain why wage growth and inflation didn’t actually fall as much as we might have expected during the downturn, but now it explains why, as the labor market is improving, wage growth isn’t picking up as much as we might expect. Turning to the topic of what could throw our forecast off course, many of you mentioned the main risks that concern you as being external—namely, events in Russia and Ukraine; slowing growth in China and potential risks pertaining to shadow banking and housing markets there; and financial-stability risks in that we’re seeing evidence of reach-for-yield behavior in fixed-income markets, including leveraged loan markets, in which terms and standards are continuing to deteriorate in spite of our guidance.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " These include diminishing fiscal drag and accommodative monetary policy, rising household net worth, and generally improved balance sheets, with continued solid gains in employment. Presidents Fisher and Plosser and Governor Fischer cautioned us to remember that with declining unemployment, wages may rise, pushing up inflation and leaving us behind the curve, with a few of you noting that the risks could entail a rise in inflation expectations, although Governor Fischer cautioned us that there is huge uncertainty around this forecast. In contrast to the concerns that were expressed that inflation may rise above our target, Presidents Rosengren, Evans, and Kocherlakota focused on exactly the opposite concern, that inflation may persist below our target for a prolonged time unless we permit unemployment to overshoot our estimate of its natural rate, along the lines contemplated in Tealbook and justified by the analysis described in the Lindner memo. Briefly, on risks to the outlook, most of you mentioned that they seemed reasonably balanced, and the main risks I heard pertained first of all to global developments, such as slowing growth and financial-stability risks in China and the possibility that tensions in the Middle East could lead to a sharp increase in energy prices. At this stage, it looks like we’ll see a pretty alarming decline in first-quarter GDP, and although most of the decline is due to large negative contributions from net exports and inventories, private domestic final purchases also seem to have slowed, and the most recent retail sales numbers haven’t been all that encouraging either.\n",

      " In particular, payroll gains in June came in well above expectations, with the three-month averages of both total and private payroll gains now standing north of 250,000 per month, and U-3 continued its recent decline and, at 6.1 percent, now stands close to where most of us in June projected it would be at year-end. Long-term unemployment and the mean duration of unemployment, as you noted, have also declined quite sharply, and research that Governor Tarullo discussed by two of our labor economists suggests that this decline in long-term unemployment, on balance, reflects movement into employment rather than the long-term unemployed just dropping out of the labor force. A number of you commented that the decline we’ve seen in U-3 overstates the decline in overall labor market slack, reflecting an unusually large fraction of the workforce that’s involuntarily unemployed and an unusually depressed labor force participation rate. Of course, it’s been surprising to see job creation running at such a fast pace in the face of such slow growth in output, but most of you seem to agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the sharp decline in GDP in the first quarter was not reflective of the underlying strength of the expansion, even during the first quarter. With respect to inflation risks, some of you are concerned that the closing of resource gaps at a faster-than-expected pace with a still highly accommodative monetary policy poses upside risks to our forecasts that we will see wage and price increases strengthen.\n",

      " I thought I would again today try to summarize at least some of the themes in your economic comments by noting how they bear on the progress we have actually achieved in closing the employment and inflation gaps and how they bear on the question of whether incoming evidence suggests that there has been any meaningful change in the likely pace of future progress. Several of you pointed out that long-term unemployment and the mean duration of unemployment have continued to decline   over the past two months, and even though it remains quite high, the share of those working part time for economic reasons also edged down in August. You cited improvement in business confidence, upbeat sentiment, perhaps diminished risk aversion by businesses, some strong manufacturing indicators, and a number of positives supporting growth. In other words, the possibility that as unemployment declines, we could see a more rapid increase in nominal wage growth in spite of the fact that when unemployment rose, we didn’t see a massive deceleration. For example, if downward nominal rigidity had kept nominal wage growth from declining during the downturn, then pent-up wage deflation could be holding it down now, even as slack is diminishing. It may be differences between the views of the Committee and market participants about the strength of the outlook, either because we are showing the most likely outcome and participants are risk-weighting different outcomes, or, alternatively, because investors may reasonably be anticipating a weaker real economy or lower inflation than we do, or at least attach meaningful odds to that possibility.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Let me now try to summarize some main themes in your economic comments by noting how they bear on the progress we have achieved in closing the employment and inflation gaps and the question of whether incoming evidence suggests any meaningful change in the likely future pace of progress. The unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point, even though the labor force participation rate also declined 0.1 percentage point, but the employment-to-population ratio edged up. The share of employees working part time for economic reasons continued to edge down, and, although it remains very high, it has participation rate ticked down again in September, it has leveled off, on balance, since last fall rather than continuing to decline, which suggests some progress in reducing the cyclical shortfall in participation. In some areas and sectors, a pickup in wage growth is now evident, and President George noted research by her staff suggesting that larger wage gains are being achieved by workers who switch jobs, as the quit rate has gradually risen. Although financial markets have been volatile and there has been some decline in the stock market and increases in credit spreads and the dollar, Treasury yields and mortgage rates have also declined, and credit conditions seem to be easing somewhat. However, several of you worried that with the United States also operating at the zero lower bound, it would be difficult to respond to weakness in the U.S. economic growth or inflation outlook if there was a more significant downgrade in the foreign outlook.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rate declined only 0.1 percentage point over the past two months, but labor force participation is up 0.1 percentage point and the employment-to-population ratio is up 0.2 percentage point since our October meeting. Of course, the outlook for the labor market depends on economic growth, and I heard most of you express reasonable confidence that, even with the downside risks we’re seeing for the global growth outlook, that you expect growth to be at least adequate to sustain continued improvement in the labor market over coming months. A number of you noted that despite slightly softer growth abroad in the third quarter, U.S. growth looks like it’s running near 3½ percent in the second half of the year, and that’s above our expectations at the time of the Looking at your SEP submissions and some of your comments, the growth outlook beyond this year hasn’t actually changed much since September, but most of you are anticipating above-trend growth. If inflation expectations were to shift down markedly, this would create downside risks to inflation itself, and a failure on our part to take decisive action could exacerbate this risk by diminishing the credibility of our commitment to our 2 percent inflation objective. It suggests that the cost of insuring against high inflation outcomes has moved down while the cost of insuring against low inflation outcomes has moved up, consistent with the decline in the equilibrium real rate.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate—the percentage of working-age Americans either working or seeking work—is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists. Compared with the projections made in December, most participants lowered their path for the federal funds rate, consistent with the downward revisions made to the projections for GDP growth and inflation as well as somewhat lower estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. The median projection for the federal funds rate is just below 2 percent in   late 2016 and rises a bit above 3 percent in late 2017. The median projected rate in 2017 remains below the 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants as the rate’s longer-run value, even though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly below that of its estimated longer-run value, and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective. Accordingly, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep. A positive aspect of what is fundamentally a disappointment is that the labor market has improved more rapidly than might have been expected given the pace of economic growth. I would expect it to pick up, and as you can see from the longer-run growth projections, most FOMC participants believe it will pick up above current levels.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Accordingly, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep. Labor force participation that has, at least, is—appears to be depressed, at least to some extent, because of cyclical weakness, and the fact that labor force participation rate has remained roughly stable for the last year or so when there’s an underlying downward trend suggests that some slack is being taken up by, in a sense, improved or diminished cyclical impact on labor force participation. At 5.5 percent, where we have an unemployment rate that still exceeds the Committee’s best attempts to estimate what is a normal unemployment rate for this economy, and, as I mentioned, there appear to be unusually large elements of slack over and above that in the form of somewhat still-depressed labor force participation and part-time work   for economic reasons. So I think it’s fair to say that most members, most participants on the Committee, wouldn’t judge yet—although some might—that most wouldn’t judge us to be at, quote, “maximum employment.”  Wage increases are still running at a low level, but there have been some tentative signs that wage growth is picking up.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That said, some cyclical weakness likely remains:  The labor force participation rate is still below estimates of its demographic trend, involuntary part-time employment remains somewhat elevated, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession. Following the financial crisis, these headwinds included tighter underwriting standards and limited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy, weak growth abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. As highlighted in our policy statement, we anticipate continuing this policy “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.”  Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should  December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL   reduce the risk that the federal funds rate might return to the effective lower bound in the event of future adverse shocks. We have been concerned, as you know, about the risks from the global economy, and those risks persist, but the U.S. economy has shown considerable strength.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Of note, the labor force participation rate has turned up noticeably since the fall, with more people working or actively looking for work as the prospects for finding jobs have improved. The median projection for the unemployment rate falls from 4.7 at the end of this year to 4.5 percent at the end of 2018, somewhat below the median assessment of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. The median path of the unemployment rate is a little lower than in December, in part reflecting a slightly lower median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. Since the turn of the year, concerns about global economic prospects have led to increased financial market volatility and somewhat tighter financial conditions in the United  States, although financial conditions have improved notably more recently. So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads. In addition to having a financial system that is more robust and less likely to experience a failure, we have also worked very hard, continue to work on making sure we have the ability to resolve a firm if it were to fail in spite—in spite of having more capital and liquidity.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In addition, growth in household spending slowed noticeably early in the year despite solid increases in household income as well as relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth. You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen to productivity growth, but productivity growth could stay long for a prolonged time, and we have an aging—aging societies in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate.1  And I think all of us are involved in a process of constantly reevaluating where is that neutral rate going, and I think what you see is a downward shift in that assessment over time, the sense that maybe more of what’s causing this neutral rate to be low are factors that are not going to be rapidly disappearing but will be part of the new normal. Now,                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say, “You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen to productivity growth, but productivity growth could stay low for a prolonged time, and we have an aging—aging societies in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate.”   June 15, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL   you still see an assessment that that neutral rate will move up somewhat, but it has been coming down, and I think it continues to be marked lower. There’s a large error around that, we often see large revisions, we should not overblow the significance of one data point, especially when other indicators of the labor market are still flashing green:  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain low; perceptions of the labor there’s a good deal of incoming data that does signal continued progress and strength in the labor So, the Committee doesn’t feel and doesn’t expect, and I don’t expect, that labor public and through our actions and through the revisions you see—have seen over time in the dot plot—that we do not have a fixed plan for raising rates over time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The fact that unemployment measures have been holding steady while the number of jobs has grown solidly shows that more people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs. But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives. Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spending extends beyond—beyond that sector, and I’m not certain of exactly what explains that, whether—I’m not aware of evidence that suggests that it’s political uncertainty, but it certainly—I would agree with the finding that it has been weak. One is the risk that the economy runs too hot, that unemploy—the labor market tightens too much, that unemployment falls to a very low level, that we need to tighten policy in a less gradual way than would be ideal, and in the course of doing that, because that is a very difficult thing to accomplish, to gently create a bit more slack in the labor market, we could cause a recession in the process. It has prompted a downward shift in the projected path for the neutral and actual federal funds rate, but it is a huge concern because slow productivity growth ultimately means slow growth in living standards.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Policies that would improve productivity growth would include policy changes that enhance education, training, workforce development; policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the quality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with; and policies that spur innovation or competition or the formation of new firms. So I want to be clear that what I said in that speech in Boston is that an important research question is whether or not, in an economy with a very strong labor market, there might be changes that took place that permanently raised the labor force participation, training, and other things of the labor—of the labor force that would be positives for the productive potential of our economy on a long-lasting basis. I think it’s very important that we have reduced the odds that a systemically important firm could fail by requiring higher capital, higher liquidity, by performing stress tests that provide us another way of ensuring that the firms we count on to supply credit to households and businesses would be able to go on doing that even in the face of a severely adverse shock. One of the things we’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that, very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn’t pick up to pre-recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy, which is called “hysteresis.”  And I raised the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " So while the balance sheet, asset purchases are a tool that we could conceivably resort to if we found ourselves in a serious downturn where we were, again, up against the zero bound and faced with substantial weakness in the economy, it’s not a tool that we would want to use as a routine tool of policy. Well, I think there’s very strong evidence that’s accumulated that this rate has been falling not just in the United States, but in many advanced nations, and the growth and also slow productivity growth here and in many other advanced nations. Now, that pace of growth has been consistent with a pace of job creation that is more rapid than what is sustainable if labor force participation begins to move down in line with what we see as its longer-run trend with an aging population. We know there are problems that face, particularly, people with less skill and education and in certain sectors of the economy, but many Americans are enjoying a stronger labor market and feel better—feel very much better about that. We’re not shooting for inflation above 2 percent, but it’s a reminder that there will be deviations above and below when we’re achieving our objective. I mean, if—if the latter were to occur, there were just a big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downward pressure on inflation and would have a negative effect on U.S. export growth and tend to boost imports.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In the labor market, job gains have averaged about 160,000 per month since the start of the year—a solid rate of growth that, although a little slower than last year, remains well above   estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force. As I pointed out, there have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a huge exceptionally low reading on core PCE in March, and that will continue to hold down 12-month changes until that reading drops out. And, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and there’s a great deal of uncertainty about it, and it’s hard to pin down, especially given the   fact that the so-called Phillips curve appears to be quite flat. Now, in the face of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low, and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors, but we certainly haven’t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation. Well, with respect to the impact of credit conditions and bank regulation on slow growth, I’ve previously, in testifying, indicated that I don’t think that our regulations have played an important role, at least broadly speaking, in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " And experience suggests that tightness in the labor market, gradually and with a lag, tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that’s also a risk, that we want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere down the road, to have to tighten monetary policy rapidly, which could cause a recession and threaten the very desirable labor market conditions that we have now. That is what we intend to use unless we think that the threat to the economy is sufficiently great that we might have to cut the federal funds rate—after all, we’ve moved it up to 1 to 1¼ percent and expect it to go up further—but a very significant negative shock to the economy could conceivably force us back to the so-called zero lower bound. We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be—it might be that growth is more rapid, the labor market tightens more quickly than we assume, and inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected—we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual. I would say that if economists are correct that we’re living in a world where the level of neutral interest rates not only in the United States, but around the world is likely to be low in the future due to slow productivity growth and demographics—now, we don’t know that that view will bear out to be correct, but it is a view that many people adhere to when there is evidence of it—then future policymakers will be faced with the question of, in the event of a severe downturn where they’re not able to provide as much stimulus as they would ideally like by cutting overnight interest rates, what other actions are available to them?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I think my colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely to be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of the reasons, I think, for the uptick you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rate. We’re enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation, and the risks in the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years. And the firms themselves have made considerable progress in, you know, changing what they do, whether it’s adopting financial contracts that would facilitate a resolution rather than a disorderly unwinding of contracts, making sure that they’re appropriately dealing with shared services so that key services would be able to continue, governance arrangements, legal entity structures—the firms have all made progress in adapting to our expectations of what would enable a successful resolution. You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inflation has also been running low on a persistent basis, and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and wants to see it moving up. And I’m considering there stronger capital, particularly for the most systemic institutions—higher-quality capital, stronger liquidity requirements, a rigorous stress-testing program, and resolution planning that will make it more possible to resolve a firm that encounters significant distress.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " What’s happened, as many of you know, is that our productivity has improved, Chinese wages and wages in emerging markets have gone up substantially, the dollar has weakened, and suddenly we’re more competitive, and my contacts expect that that will continue. Interestingly,                                                            like Governor Stein, for 2013 and 2014, I projected growth that was modestly above baseline, with faster declines in unemployment and slightly higher inflation. My underlying view is that the headwinds will continue to gradually abate, and so that growth will strengthen if we can just avoid more setbacks, either the imported kind or the self-inflicted kind. As for inflation in the near and medium term, I generally see the risks as weighted to slower economic growth rather than higher inflation. In fact, the only certainty is that there will be increasing uncertainty as the year goes on, and I see that as likely to damp risk-taking in the                                                          Finally, in an attempt to end on a positive note, I will say that I served at Treasury 20 years ago during difficult economic times, and I felt pessimistic as we left Washington at the suggestion of the American voters in early 1993. As I weigh the arguments against extending the MEP, in the end, I don’t find them carrying the day, mostly because of the presence of significant financial market stress and the very real threat that it could get a lot worse.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In my model I’m not impressed particularly by evidence and arguments that there’s a lot of structural damage. The timing seems to me to line up pretty well with our repeated attempts and failed attempts to reach escape velocity, and therefore, I disagree with proposition five, which is the proposition that a little bit of good data wouldn’t impress. Moving on to my comments, I see the economy’s performance since the last meeting as having been a little bit weaker on balance than expectations, with a handful of positives, mainly housing and autos, and a greater number of negatives, including government spending, household spending, and significantly weakness in the industrial sector. That means continued slow growth, around 2 percent, which I expect will strengthen as the year goes on despite the likelihood of periodic shocks from Europe, Washington D.C., and maybe the Middle East. Rather                                     than be chased by low rates into taking more risk, some are happy to stay in cash. As far as the benefits are concerned, I would say that I suspect that our ability to increase employment by lowering rates is very limited at present; I’ve got real doubts about efficacy. On the list of potential costs, I would include inflation, the difficulty of exit, the risk of creating expectations we can’t meet, the prospect of capital losses, market function, and the grab bag of stability issues.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We had positive news early in the intermeeting period, which was a trip to hope and back, and it left me very much in the same place where I started:  I see an economy with a substantial amount of slack that is growing at about 2 percent;                                              inflation that is bouncing around just below 2 percent on commodity effects, but close to target; and better financial conditions for now. There’s a sick feeling in people’s stomachs                                                   that this is really bad, that this is our country not being able to function, and it’s like last August on steroids—not that there’s anything wrong with steroids. Second, leveraged finance markets, as Andreas was discussing this morning, are very attractive, with low rates and issuer-favorable                                                          terms that are just about reminiscent of the bubble days, and all of that provides critical flexibility in case deals don’t go well. But I will say that it’s a bit of a signal to me because this is a group of investors with very successful and, in some cases, long track records that were looking ahead to strong growth in the medium term, and they were willing to put more than just an opinion on the line in that belief. My concern is that for very modest benefits, we are piling up risks for the future and that it could become habit-forming.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Like others, I see difficult                                                       problems of implementation, and to me, they add up to reasons to go slow at a minimum. It’s something we ought to take slowly, particularly since there’s no urgent need to make a change and no obvious net benefit in doing so in the short term. The difficult question, of course, is, when we disagree with the public, we’re just going to have to explain ourselves, and it’s going to have to be credible. While I see some improvement at the which is obviously not strong enough to reduce unemployment. Like others, I found a dichotomy between the household sector, where there’s been a fairly strong run of data, being to some extent canceled out by the weakness of the business sector. It has been well covered by many around the table, so I’ll skip to the punch line on that dichotomy to say that it’s not easy to                                                       generate a story that accounts for both the strength in households and the weakness and uncertainty in business. I think the hope has to be that a good part of the business weakness comes from the decline in global trade, as President Plosser suggested, and that does seem to be part of the story—the overall weakness in Europe and Asia and the decline in global trade— rather than activity here at home.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I suspect that for most of 2013, we will remain in the world of 2 percent economic growth and 2 percent inflation, maybe even a little bit lower in both cases, with modest progress, therefore, on reducing unemployment. But there are other signs of weakness:  I would point to corporate profits, which have been down; guidance has been down across the board; capital spending is down and weak. There’s tremendous uncertainty around those numbers, and even conditional on those losses, we can’t know the effects of losses like that until the events actually occur several years down the road. The first is that I would move my marginal cost curve higher for any given level of x, and the second is that in the face of uncertainty, as distinct from measurable risk, I would want to proceed in discrete amounts under a stopping rule, and of course, that is arguably the intended design of the LSAP policy. Our stopping rule depends fundamentally on perception of a lack of efficacy, and I am concerned about the cases in which efficacy is debatable, under which we keep on purchasing, even though we may lower expectations as we do in case 3 of the Chairman’s handout. More Treasury purchases are unlikely to increase consumer or business confidence, and as far as the stock market and the wealth effect are concerned, the expected 10-year real return on equities has been range-bound for three years while we have, along with other forces, managed to drive down real 10-year returns by more than 200 basis points.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " If that state of affairs persists and if the underlying narrative has been correct, we should finally see, perhaps as the year moves along, the arrival of the long-awaited pickup in economic growth to a level that’s worthy of a recovery, and that is the narrative that the financial particularly credit availability for less-creditworthy households. Although it doesn’t show up yet in the dealer survey, some investors are saying that they sense the end of quantitative easing over the horizon, and as a result, there’s a sense of a rotation into equities and away from the safety of Treasuries, which accounts for some of the very large increase in the yield on the 10-year. While financial conditions are a net positive, there’s also reason to be concerned about the growing market distortions created by our continuing asset purchases. Rates are low; spreads are not that low yet, but they’re definitely tightening; and terms are deteriorating rapidly. I think the likelihood that we will see a substantial improvement in the labor market is rising, and so are the financial stability risks that are a consequence of our asset purchases. I would echo those who noted positively the paper on fiscal matters by Seth Carpenter and others, and I’d say that I think that is a very positive and significant step toward improving transparency and opens the door for more.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Sixty-four percent of them feel that “it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to be very accommodative” but question “the need, effectiveness, and/or risks of ongoing quantitative easing”—their words. Seventy-four percent are “concerned about exit” and said that “the larger the balance sheet gets, the bigger the exit strategy risk.”  Sixty-four percent say that “the Fed is luring people into investments that may not really make sense to them.”  When asked which asset classes they would characterize as “artificially influenced by the Fed’s actions,” 84 percent identified high-yield bonds, and 80 percent U.S. Treasuries. The result could be a very serious confrontation, one with a great deal of downside risk to the forecast and no prospect at all of commensurate benefits. It’s an understatement to say that LSAP effects are uncertain, but if forced to be pinned down on this, I would pick the “Reduced interest sensitivity” column on page 7 of the efficacy memo, which is 12 basis points in unemployment reduction for $500 billion in purchases. Communication is the main tool by which, I think, we do manage financial stability, and, in that light, the lack of clarity around our stopping rule for asset purchases is itself a financial stability risk. These changes     would reduce financial stability risk, shorten the time to normalization, and reduce the risk of low remittances and accounting capital, all at what I see as very limited or no cost to policy.\n",

      " I see the data since the last meeting as mixed and modestly disappointing, on balance, but not so bad as to require a downward adjustment to the outlook. Echoing several others around the table, some of my industrial-sector contacts reported that their antennas are up now to the possibility of a flatter year than expected, and that’s in contrast with a more positive sentiment for the March meeting. Since early 2010, the economy has oscillated through periods of strength and weakness around a 2 percent growth rate. So if one were to take the Tealbook forecast for the rest of 2013 but back out the arguable one-timers—that would mean subtracting the snapback from the drought and the hurricane, but also adding back the fiscal drag from the tax increases and the full sequestration—economic growth would be 3.2 percent in the first half and 3.4 percent for the full year. The case for tapering would be that since the program was initiated in September, we’ve achieved substantial progress toward our economic objectives in the form of lower unemployment and higher payrolls. If that turns out to be what happens, it’ll take several years to reduce reserves to the point at which they have any scarcity value, let alone to “the smallest levels that would be consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy.”  In the meantime, there is going to be slippage between interest on reserves and the federal funds rate, and the relationship may not be a stable one.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " There are good reasons to expect continued improvement, and I would number among them increasing consumer confidence, strong housing I will touch a little bit more in detail on housing as a bright spot. In addition, at 2.7 percent of GDP, residential investment is still far below its historical trend level and ordinarily would have been expected to grow strongly for many years, adding more meaningfully to growth. Downside risks seem to me to have diminished, although I would say that the risk is in the direction of lower GDP and higher unemployment. And I want to touch on inflation, as many others have, which has been very low and could present a real problem for our policy if expectations drop or if observed inflation breaks still lower. The first is that it’s clear that we have accumulated a large stock of progress in growing payrolls and reducing unemployment since the September meeting, when the substantial improvement test was adopted. It’s crucial to me that this be tied to a path to achieving a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and I think any other explanation tastes and smells like an admission of failure, and I don’t think that’s appropriate. I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility, but I have to say I am concerned that there may be more than that here.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My own executive summary would be that there was a modest adjustment in policy expectations, an increase in uncertainty about policy, and then a lot of of carry trades and to hedge increasing duration as MBS rates increased. Market participants generally now say that we are in a better and more sustainable place as far as the state of the market is concerned. If we had waited for three or six more months, or another year, the reaction may well have grown larger and potentially more damaging to the economy. Risks can build up around these commitments in ways that are difficult to observe in real time and that are difficult to unwind without risking a sharp tightening in financial conditions and damage to the economy. The nearer-term risk may instead be that the process of exit itself will provoke a sharp and damaging tightening in financial conditions, and that risk may grow as rates remain very low over time, particularly if we add more open-ended commitments. We did so at some risk, but things now seem to me to have settled down in a place that is more realistic and sustainable, and that should not pose a major headwind to economic growth. For me, the main positives are the strong June employment report; the SLOOS was very positive; consumer confidence is the highest it has been since before the crisis, although it is still below historical normal levels; auto sales are back at their pre-crisis high.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " And with that lower growth, my forecast also calls for unemployment to decrease a little slower than in the baseline, to 6.2 percent by the end of 2015, which is still a faster pace than the weak GDP growth would predict. I’ll just say that there are the three narratives that he mentioned, which are that GDP may be being misleadingly reported and will be revised up later, that we may be seeing supply-side damage, or that this might be just more catch-up from the period of excess firing during the financial crisis. In particular, the public and the markets seem to think that this fall’s debt ceiling and government shutdown confrontation is just more bread and circuses to entertain the populace, and that amounts really to a huge unpriced risk. The Tealbook continues to call for growth to increase significantly during the balance of the year at a somewhat lower rate than was expected in June, but given all of the near-term uncertainty around productivity and the link between GDP and unemployment, this part of the test is one where we have to be very careful, and it probably has the least clear connection to the fulfillment of our mandate right now. As far as inflation is concerned, readings since June, to me, suggest that inflation has stabilized below our mandate-consistent rate, and that the very low readings of Q2 were probably an anomaly.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " On the other hand, many offered negative comments about the course of events in Washington, and there was a division between those who saw the shutdown and the debt ceiling standoff as having hurt their results and those who did not. And since then, in my view, at the margin there are additional signs of weakness as, perhaps, more accommodative financial conditions have not quite offset the drag from the confrontation. I would include uncertainty about the effects of increasing house prices, lingering concerns about future income, uncertainty about government fiscal and regulatory policy, and rising inequality. But the point is that what was a problem in the summer of 2013 may not be a problem in March or June of 2014, given the passage of time and progress toward the unemployment threshold. We know that long periods of suppressed volatility can lead to the buildup of risks and to a disruptive ending, and the idea that monetary policy can ignore that and leave it to macroprudential tools just is not credible to me. On the other hand, we see that it’s not difficult to show that any mechanical rule can deliver a false positive or negative, which makes it a very difficult quest. But what to do if the economy continues on more or less its current path of 2 percent growth, payroll gains that oscillate between decent and meager, and declining unemployment helped along partly by unwanted declines in the labor force    participation rate, or, alternatively, perhaps the declines in unemployment will slow or stop as labor force participation stabilizes?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " And the big vote margin in the House suggests that there won’t be a shutdown or a debt-ceiling crisis early next year, although, as Dan pointed out, there are more recent reports that do suggest that that unhappy possibility remains alive. What has been consistent since 2009 has been a faster decline in unemployment for a given amount of GDP growth, which has led the staff to substantially downgrade its assessment of the supply side of the economy. In that connection, I was struck both by the recent Board analysis and by a paper by Shigeru Fujita of the Philadelphia Fed that shows that the surprising and unwelcome declines in the labor force participation rate since 2011 are entirely due to retirements and not to an increase in discouraged workers. All of that leads me to expect payrolls to gradually increase above a couple hundred thousand per month as the economy improves, but with good months and bad months around that trend, accompanied by fairly rapid declines in the unemployment rate. It also seems to me that the incoming data and, particularly, the supply-side damage story do weaken the argument that the U3 unemployment rate is sending a misleading signal about labor market slack. So we absolutely got the first two done, and I thought that the third element would be virtually impossible to satisfy, and that was the basis for my confident prediction that we would not be able to taper until March.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Still, I’m left with the thought that the case for 3 percent or better economic growth in 2014 overall feels much more plausible now on the back of the strength that the economy has shown. The question of how should the Committee react to a world of solid economic growth, low inflation, but high and rising asset prices, presents itself as a possibility—again, not a forecast. To me, the danger of financial-stability risks comes now as the recovery strengthens, and I don’t know that the current guidance adequately addresses that. I don’t have great certainty about this, but I worry that it will send a signal that the Committee is concerned. I think it’s ideal to have a plan that covers most of the probabilities out there—not just a few of them, but really most of them—so that the increased materially more than is suggested in the baseline. I don’t know whether that would be reflected in the statement or not, but a strong prior now is that this band of people that the Chairman added up at the beginning of the meeting are out there and could potentially be gotten back by a stronger                                                                          economy and stronger demand, and if we don’t have financial-stability or inflation concerns, we ought to keep going and see whether that’s the case. On the other hand, if the labor force participation rate flattens out and increases a little bit, that does say that there are people out there who will come back into the labor force, and that’s a very positive message.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " To me, there are good reasons to think that labor market slack may be even higher, and I would cite the disproportionate decline of the labor force participation rate below our estimate of trend and the unusually high level of those who are working part time for economic reasons. For these and other reasons, my prior is that the unemployment gap more likely understates slack than overstates it. The excellent memo by Katia Peneva asks whether long-term unemployment exerts less downward pressure on compensation than does short-term unemployment. Even as people fall out of the labor force—for example, after their benefits expire—there’s a reasonable likelihood that their attachment to the labor force would return if jobs were plentiful. Along the way, I expressed a fair amount of concern that the Committee could lose control of the current asset purchase program because of what I saw as the lack of a stopping rule that covered most of the reasonably likely outcomes, and I’m very pleased to note that that didn’t happen. A successful middle course between those two risks will obviously involve rates moving up and volatility returning to normal levels as the economy improves. I’m happy to have “short-term interest rates” changed to “the federal funds rate.” I’m going to take some risk with this, but I’m going to go ahead and say it, and that is, I think a dovish dissent at this meeting does increase the risk of a perception in the market that this is a hawkish surprise.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For now, I would want to size that RRP facility at the lowest level that would achieve a reasonably tight floor and enable a clean liftoff. And what I would do is gradually move the RRP up closer to the IOER rate to achieve the desired size. There would be problems of contract frustration, and it might be difficult down the road, it is said, to return to a corridor system based on the federal funds rate. Actually, the more difficult objection for me is that the size of the balance sheet is a matter of choice under a floor system. With good intermeeting readings on retail sales, manufacturing, and consumer confidence, I see economic growth rebounding to a level more consistent with the second half of last year. And I worry that there are other longer-term trends associated with poor job opportunities for younger people and lack of credit availability for weaker households. I know there is some volatility there, but, holding all else equal, that                                             bigger denominator would slow down progress in reducing headline unemployment but would, nonetheless, be a very welcome development. Along with nearly 3 percent economic growth, I expect we’ll continue to see improvement in the labor markets and unemployment declining nearly to 6 percent by year-end. The risk of continued rising froth in fixed-income markets, followed by a correction that could halt progress, is a real one.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I was going to talk about this in my comments, but because of the LIBOR work that I have been involved in, I’ve spent a fair amount of time on this contract                                                    frustration issue, and my answer to the question of do we need to let the contract frustration issue drive this is “no.”  I mean, there are other things that can be weighed back and forth, but under New York law, it’s a very, very difficult case to make, and we’ve got pretty good facts that just wouldn’t fit within any of the precedents that have been done, in my view. To be specific, the risk in the near term, to me, is not that of a meltdown at the core of the system, which is much stronger and better protected than before the crisis, but rather that of a sharp correction amplified by the liquidity mismatch in the markets that would damage or halt the progress of what is still a weak economy. Low volatility gives a feeling of safety and encourages the taking of risks, often in the form of levered bets, and a sudden increase in volatility can also lead to a sudden flight from these positions, big price movements across financial asset classes, and a significant tightening of financial conditions. With the support of the economic environment, low rates, and no covenants to violate, defaults are low and should remain low for a while, but these trends suggest that the ultimate wave of defaults will be quite large when it does materialize.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But if we try to make a decision today, it stands a big chance of being off by quite a bit, and therefore, the incentive is to guess high so as to avoid weakening monetary control—for example, by having a $500 billion overall cap, which is so much higher than these other levels. I am a little less enthusiastic about giving the Chair intermeeting discretion to increase the aggregate or surge caps, as that would risk sending a signal that the facility is designed to expand; I guess I would support that discretion, but prefer that it be used only as necessary. Without going through the whole memo, let me just say that the facility raises serious financial-stability concerns and related concerns about unpredictable effects on industry structure. In my view, the threat of inflation to remain persistently low has clearly diminished. Also, looking at history and bearing in mind that the Committee does not do price-level targeting, it’s worth noting that the PCE price index level is about 3 percent lower than it would have been if inflation had been 2 percent since the end of 2007, and it’s 1½ percent lower than it would have been if inflation had run at 2 percent since the end of the recession in 2009. Real wage growth has been well below what it should be, and a tighter economy could remedy that and pull even more back into the labor force. I wouldn’t do that, for two reasons:  first, the concern about leaning too hard on inflation expectations and, second, the concern about courting extreme financial market conditions with three or four more years of policy that is more accommodative than almost all of the standard policy rules.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " If we don’t do it at the beginning, it’s going to make what’s already going to be a challenging process more difficult. But it may say something, even though some of that economic growth may have been stolen from Q1 of this year, about the underlying strength of the economy in the period ahead that we’re underestimating. In any case, on this path, the unemployment rate will be within the central tendency of the Committee’s estimates of full employment by late next year and below that tendency by the end of 2016, and that’s true for my forecast as well. Another question concerns the labor force participation rate and whether it might retrace some of the declines since 2007. That paper also projects that labor force participation should decline another 2½ percent over the next decade, or about 25 basis points a   year, and the path described in the paper shows the rate essentially flat as the economy continues to recover through 2015 and then declining steadily over the coming decade. There’s not a high degree of accuracy in this, nor is it a prediction or anything, but if the path estimated by the staff paper is directionally right, then a few years of labor force participation at 63 percent, give or take a couple of tenths, are one way that the cyclical return of the labor force might actually show itself.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Like others, the broad picture I see is one of continued U.S. strength threatened in the medium term by weakness abroad and accompanied not only by more volatile financial conditions and a stronger dollar, but also by lower commodity prices, lower interest rates, and a still-strong equity market. I guess I would say I have a low level of conviction that the significant effects on economic growth that are in the baseline will turn out to have been justified, and I would tend to look at them more as real downside risks. In the Tealbook forecast, economic growth is marked down, and employment growth is in 2015, and I guess I would say that seems like a big markdown to me. That would push out the time to full employment by about 50 percent, and it just feels to me like there is significant upside risk there, the mistake being that for any quantum of GDP growth, we’re underestimating the amount of payroll growth. Turning to inflation briefly, it is declining and now thanks to lower energy prices and a strong dollar, the forecast has moved down. I do see that the real risk to inflation is lower growth, and I do believe that if we hit our growth projections we will see inflation move back to 2 percent as we get around full employment. I think if that level of growth materializes or is seen as likely to materialize, the dollar could easily retrace some of its recent strength, which seems to have been driven by increased perceptions of tail risk in Europe.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Consumer spending ought to be strong, supported by much lower energy prices, higher levels of confidence, continued low interest rates, and higher stock prices. The first is the gap between the relatively strong performance here in the United States and the weakness we see in Europe and elsewhere around the world, the threat being that we will feel this weakness over time, perhaps through the stronger dollar or through the risk-off channel if the bad events do happen. The Board model happens to assign the smallest amount to actual expectations of lower inflation and to inflation risk premiums and the largest amount to liquidity premiums, which is really meant to capture the greater attraction of nominals due to their higher liquidity as well as other factors related to supply and demand. My own sense is that the Treasury market is, in fact, pricing in lower oil prices and stronger foreign demand for Treasuries as opposed to concerns about slower U.S. growth or lower inflation. I’m not suggesting that that process needs to be destabilizing or destructive, but I do think that they point to risks of weaker growth and lower inflation, and perhaps I’m just constitutionally more focused on avoiding downside risks, or it may be that the risks to the downside actually are greater and represent more difficult challenges for policy than the upside risks—for example, the risk that we might get several more payroll reports well in the 300,000 level.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher. By contrast, raising rates too slowly would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion. The Committee’s estimates of growth went up, the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation. You know, so as you noted, the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below. You know, we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth. Since the financial crisis, we’ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and, sort of, measures of various aspects of financial—financial stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let’s say. On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven’t seen, you know, higher wages—wages going up more.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion. You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower, we’re near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’re going to be down at the zero lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective. You know, what we’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent. It’s really important that inflation not fall below 2 percent, that inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent—very important—because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that you’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ll spend more time there and we won’t be able to do the job that we’re assigned to do for our citizens. If you’re—if you’re worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate—that’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation? I am confident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad. We’ve also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system through higher capital and better regulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, which are meant to strengthen the financial system. But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that. We have stress tests, which force banks to understand—the largest banks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as the financial crisis. I think we—if we look at mortgage credit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit— good credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Over the past year the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows, and inflation has been low and stable. This growth was predicted to push the       unemployment rate down to near historic lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was expected to help push inflation up to 2 percent. The additional tightening of financial conditions we have seen over the past couple of months along with signs of somewhat weaker growth abroad have also led us to mark down growth and inflation projections a bit. And during that period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflation has still remained just a      touch below 2 percent. And that is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchoring inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or around the target so it doesn’t go down as much—inflation doesn’t go down as much in a downturn and doesn’t go up as much when the—you know, when the economy is strong. And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the large regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appropriately tailored regulation and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community should they fail—should they experience material difficulty.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains. We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the risks to the baseline, and the risks are, of course, the fact that financial conditions have tightened, that global growth has slowed, as well as some, let’s say, government-related risks like Brexit and trade discussions, and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown. But so the Committee is—what we’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer-run goal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct—efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn’t put our goals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil. So, we did—we’ve called out corporate debt as a risk—more of a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, the sense of that being that if you have companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they’re going to be less able to weather that and keep serving their customers and, you know, may have to do layoffs and things like that.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants. If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country. It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals, so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation, confidence. They’re far better capitalized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial crisis. What we really mean is that we would look at—we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target. I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target—  particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that core will be too—that gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being achieved. But the sense of our tapering is that—“tailoring,” sorry—our tailoring policy is that the highest expectations fall upon the largest, most systemically important, most complex institutions, and then at every step along the way, the expectations become more tailored to the risks that that institution actually presents to the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment. At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations. Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times. We were able to quickly identify the problem:  It was an internal problem, and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves. As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals, but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle—those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Inflation has been running somewhat below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market. In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1  Moreover, manufacturing production has posted participants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment and the crosscurrents I mentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen. factors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more sustained shortfall of inflation. But I would just say that the risks that we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of us to write down rate cuts, and a number of those who haven’t to see that the case has strengthened. You know, I would think that, to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut, that would support—tend to support activity.3  So we’re really focused on, you know, the risks to our—on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks. But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the economy, and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective. This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job   Through the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates. In terms of the rest of your question, the Committee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned:  to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy, that those factors are—where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation. What we’ve been monitoring since the beginning of the year is, effectively, downside risks to that outlook from weakening global growth, and we see that everywhere:  weak manufacturing, weak global growth now, particularly in the European Union and China. And it is not—it’s not exactly the same as watching global growth, where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle. You mentioned lower r*, trade slowdown—and I would actually add, lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which   kind of point to more accommodation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half, and job gains have remained solid in recent months. As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks. As our statement also highlights, though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments. So I don’t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we’re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we’ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively. And, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I’ve said before, that it’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has much more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer-run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force   participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers. And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this:  that low rates abroad are a symbol—or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, expectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid; we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace. Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year. In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July. The performance of the economy has been—particularly the household sector—has been strong, has been resilient, with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, labor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending. So, in terms of risks, what I was referring to there—the principal risks that we’ve been monitoring have been, really, slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure. It’s particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple of years. So we’re—I think, again, I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up so that—reserves move up and down with some volatility.\n",

      " Of course, he’s best known for leading the fight to tame the double-digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid. While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer-term inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower. Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments. And, by the way, this is—it’s a good thing that, you know, we think we can—I think we’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation. And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant—a significant move-up in inflation that’s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns. And I think that the fact that these communities have so much—such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.\n",

      " However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid-2018. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid. While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead longer-term inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower. It’s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to 2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around—symmetrically around 2 percent, and that we’re not satisfied with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now where we’re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up. The—it’s a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment, we haven’t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and other periods of low unemployment. So those are challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would say that, under our existing framework, we’ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it for most of the time lately to achieve those goals, although we do struggle, as other central banks do, with the inflation goal.\n",

If increases in both inflation and deflation raise risk premiums and retard growth, it follows that risk premiums are lowest at price stability. These problems are becoming pervasive in modern economies as high tech and service prices, which are generally more difficult to measure, become ever more prominent in aggregate price measures.

The constraint on the average maturity ensures a degree of private sector \"burden sharing\" in times of crisis, since in the event of a crisis, the market value of longer maturities would doubtless fall sharply. If the preponderance of a country's liabilities are short term, the entire burden of a crisis would fall on the emerging market economy in the form of a run on reserves.Some emerging countries may argue that they have difficulty selling long-term maturities. There is no credible way to fully preclude a counterproductive effort to gain costless benefits with new financial products that convert long-term liabilities to short.Clearly it would not be feasible at present for most emerging market countries to implement a policy regime based on liquidity at risk.

Corporate management is wholly aware that a slow response to a breakdown can bring revenue losses in the short run and an erosion of their customer base in the long run. While ingenious solutions can sometimes originate from the executive suite, more often than not they grow out of the ability of engineers, technicians, and workers on the factory floor to improvise a temporary fix for a critical problem. Although the desirability of publicizing the existence of a pending significant technical breakdown was never in question--and never should have been--it always raised the potential hazard of an outsized, if only partly informed, disruptive reaction by the public. Given the potentially broad range of uncertain outcomes at the CDC, the cost of advance preventative preparations in most cases is probably correctly perceived by businesses and households to be low, or at least acceptable. Because businesses are effectively buying insurance against an uncertainty, the less uncertainty, the smaller the perceived insurance need.

However one views the causes of our low inflation and strong growth, there can be little argument that the American economy as it stands at the beginning of a new century has never exhibited so remarkable a prosperity for at least the majority of Americans. How well policy can be fashioned to allow the private sector to maximize the benefits of innovations that we currently enjoy, and to contain the imbalances they create, will shape the economic configuration of the first part of the new century.Footnotes1  Since the early 1990s, the annual growth rate in output per hour of nonfinancial corporate businesses outside high tech has risen by a full percentage point.2  For example, the emergence of many alternate technologies in areas where only one or two will set the standard and survive has created high-risk, high-reward outcomes for their creators.

Perhaps the most significant innovation has been the development of financial instruments that enable risk to be reallocated to the parties most willing and able to bear that risk. Apparently, firms hesitate to raise prices for fear that their competitors will be able to wrest market share from them by employing new investments to produce at lower costs.Indeed, the increasing availability of labor-saving equipment and software, at declining relative prices and with improving delivery lead times, is arguably at the root of the loss of business pricing power in recent years.

For example, the lax standards, excesses, and fraud present in the recent few recent bank failures show that even as most banks post record profits, the deposit insurance fund can still experience disproportionate losses from undisciplined institutions. When strong conditions largely mask the susceptibility of marginal borrowers, stress testing is invaluable for revealing the magnitude of portfolio risk posed by more challenging economic conditions. Moreover, while larger organizations may have some advantage over smaller banks through their brand identity and larger budgets for technology and marketing, community banks are more likely to have a comparative advantage in understanding the diverse needs of their customer base and in their ability to respond quickly with personalized service.More fully recognizing and responding to customer needs is particularly important when viewed in the context of trends in wealth formation in our economy.

      "  Remarks by Chairman Alan GreenspanThe challenge of measuring and modeling a dynamic economyAt the Washington Economic Policy Conference of the National Association for Business Economics, Washington, D.C.March 27, 2001I am pleased to have this opportunity to address an issue of considerable importance to both business economists and policymakers--that is, the challenge of measuring and modeling our dynamic economy. Econometricians recognized many of these difficulties, and so developed a vast and elegant literature in support of this research program, covering a spectrum of topics ranging from maximum-likelihood-estimation techniques to tests for coefficient stability to diagnostics for detecting undesirable properties of the errors of these equations. But in time it became increasingly clear that, for all their theoretical advantages, these sophisticated models did not reliably outperform a number of simple and far less costly reduced-form models, from the money supply models that appeared to work well for a while during the 1970s, to astructural vector autoregression models based on a handful of lagged variables that are still employed today. Obviously, we should do both, but I suspect greater payoffs will come from more data than from more technique. Problems that were always latent in defining steel prices and quantities but rarely rose to this level of significance are threatening to seriously challenge our measurement systems in an age of the microprocessor, fiber optics, and the laser. More generally, I am certain that the possibilities for creatively harnessing technology for the improvement of economic measurement are much broader in scope--although, as in many other areas of endeavor, the precise directions those advances will take are difficult to predict.\n",

The industry needed to resolve its problems, improve its risk management practices, and construct new strategies that would provide more stability in lending markets and more competitive, long-term returns to investors. When the economy begins to slow and the quality of some booked loans deteriorates, loan standards belatedly tighten and supervisors’ criticism of previous standards is taken more seriously, inducing an even greater tightening of credit.

      " Our ability to take full advantage of these opportunities depends crucially on how well we as a nation can integrate these new technologies into our society.In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspective on the challenges created by the interaction of new technologies with the skills of the American workforce, and how the educational system has in the past and can in the future respond to these challenges.The process of innovation is, of course, never ending. Our market-driven educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high school enrollment in this country expanded rapidly, pulling youth from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into more productive occupations in business and broadening the skills of students to meet the needs of an advancing manufacturing sector. In broad terms, the basic structure of higher education remains much the same today, and it has been one that has proven sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs of a changing economy.Certainly, if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education must remain the world leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor. However, the pressure to enable all workers to benefit from the new technologies also requires that we strengthen the significant contributions of other types of training and educational programs, especially for those with lesser skills.The notion that formal degree programs at any scholastic level or that any other training program established today can be crafted to fully support the requirements of one’s full working life has become subject to increasing doubt.\n",

      " In fact, if we accept a total net wealth effect on consumption of 3 to 5 cents on the dollar, and if further analysis supports the larger net spending propensities from capital gains on homes suggested by mortgage and survey data, then the propensity to spend out of each dollar of stock market gains would be less than the propensity to spend out of a dollar from gains on homes, but still larger in overall dollar magnitude.Of course, these quantitative magnitudes are tentative, and a great deal of additional work will be necessary to better understand and to confirm the nature and magnitudes of the relationships between capital gains on houses and stocks--realized and unrealized--and consumer spending. Offsetting this decline, to some extent, has been an increase in dividend and other capital income.If private and state and local defined-benefit pension plans had been separated from the personal sector, the personal saving rate would have fallen about 3/4 percentage point less from 1995 to 2000, all else being equal.All told, if households viewed taxes on capital gains as a subtraction from those gains and not from income and, further, if households viewed benefit payments received from defined-benefit plans as income rather than their employers' contributions (as well as the investment income of the plans), perceived disposable income in 2000 would have been higher as would the personal saving rate. In the absence of capital gains, borrowing merely moves up a purchase rather than augmenting total purchases through time.However, in the presence of increased capital gains, unrealized but still perceived as permanent, debt capacity and levels are likely to rise.\n",

      " Where home       ownership flourishes, it is no surprise to find increased neighborhood stability,       more civic-minded residents, better school systems, and reduced crime rates. With these important benefits, an increased rate of home ownership has been       chosen by our society as a national priority, with many public- and private-sector       resources devoted to achieving this goal. Additionally, the homeownership rate among households earning       less than the median income increased more than three times the pace for       households with incomes above the median. To the extent that market participants discriminate--consciously or, more       insidiously, unconsciously--capital does not flow to its most profitable       uses, and the distribution of output is distorted.

      " Adding to the intense forces         weighing on asset prices and economic activity before September 11 were         new sources of uncertainty and risk that began to press down on global         demand for goods and services. The synchronous slowing in activity raised         concerns that a self-reinforcing cycle of contraction, fed by perceptions         of greater economic risk, could develop. In those earlier years,         imbalances were inadvertently allowed to build to such an extent that         their inevitable correction engendered significant economic stress. A slowing in the rate of inventory liquidation will induce a rise in industrial         production if demand for those products is stable or is falling only moderately. On that score, despite a number         of encouraging signs of stabilization, it is still premature to conclude         that the forces restraining economic activity here and abroad have abated         enough to allow a steady recovery to take hold. The pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially         after September 11, and the unemployment rate rose sharply. Moreover, despite the failure of Congress to enact further         tax cuts and spending increases, the continued phase-in of earlier reductions         in taxes and the significant expansion of discretionary spending already         enacted should provide noticeable short-term stimulus to demand. But if the recent more favorable developments continue and gather momentum,         uncertainties will diminish, risk premiums will fall, and the pace of         capital investment increase.

      " Savers have been in sufficient abundance since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to enable investment to further material well-being. Money, as a store of value, was an early facilitator of savings and one of the great inventions of mankind. Saving and investment is very difficult in a barter economy.The history of money is the history of civilization or, more exactly, of some important civilizing values. Its form at any particular period of history reflects the degree of confidence, or the degree of trust, that market participants have in the institutions that govern every market system, whether centrally planned or free.To accept money in exchange for goods and services requires a trust that the money will be accepted by another purveyor of goods and services. And, at the base of the financial system, with the abandonment of gold convertibility in the 1930s, legal tender became backed--if that is the proper term--by the fiat of the state.The value of fiat money can be inferred only from the values of the present and future goods and services it can command. This has been the case in the United States, and the dollar, despite many challenges to its status, remains the principal international currency.If the evident recent success of fiat money regimes falters, we may have to go back to seashells or oxen as our medium of exchange.

      " Even discounting somewhat the phenomenal strength of the growth of output per hour of late, one cannot help but be impressed with how well productivity has held up in the face of the abrupt slowing of the economy in late 2000 and in 2001. In response to these reduced penalties on risk, firms will be induced to adjust the mix of their endeavors toward more-speculative projects--but, importantly, presumably ones that also offer higher prospective rates of return on average, which more often than not, translate into higher long-term average economic growth.Thus, the answer to whether government or private saving does more to foster productivity growth arguably comes down to the propensity of U.S. savers to take risks.Government saving is reflected largely in a retirement of debt.

A company's share price, and hence the value of related options, is heavily influenced by economy-wide forces--that is, by changes in interest rates, inflation, and myriad other forces wholly unrelated to the success or failure of a particular corporate strategy.There have been more than a few dismaying examples of CEOs who nearly drove their companies to the wall and presided over a significant fall in the price of the companies' stock relative to that of their competitors and the stock market overall. Making an estimate of option expense requires no significant additional burden to the company.If, however, markets do not fully see through the failure to expense real factor inputs, market values are distorted and real capital resources are being diverted from their most efficient employment.

      " The financing of this high level of spending with debt,         which was seen as prudent when equity valuations were high, led to a rise         in defaults when firms were no longer able to repay bank loans and other         debt through equity issuance in a depressed stock market. After three or         four years of economic expansion, loan growth, and rising profits, the         Asian crisis and the Russian default sent a strong and timely message         to U.S. banks to raise their credit standards and more actively manage         their existing portfolios to limit risk exposures. The most recent credit         cycle has created an abundant supply of exactly the kind of critical information         that banks will need to improve their risk-management: information about         default rates and the associated losses by borrower and loan type.

      " Although wars, international conflicts, and economic crises have interrupted our progress from time to time, we have, nonetheless, persisted in learning to use our hard-won knowledge to alter our physical and social environment for the better. This process has enabled valued goods to be transported more easily and to be produced with ever fewer workers, allowing a more efficient division of labor to propel overall output and standards of living progressively higher.The share of the nation's output that is conceptual appears to have accelerated after World War II with the insights that led to the development of the transistor and microprocessor. Although the relative contribution of any single factor remains under debate, most observers would agree that the success of these factors in accounting for relative rates of economic growth across countries lies importantly in the interactions of the determinants themselves. What makes that system work effectively is that it has been influenced importantly by the values of a strong market economy--competition, risk-taking, and innovation.America's reputation as a world leader in higher education is grounded in the ability of these versatile institutions, taken together, to serve the practical needs of an economy and, more important, to unleash the creative thinking that moves a society forward. The challenge for our institutions of higher education is to successfully blend the exposure to all aspects of human intellectual activity, especially our artistic propensities and our technical skills.The challenge is particularly daunting because scientific knowledge expands and broadens the measurable rewards of its curriculum at a pace that liberal arts, by their nature, have difficulty matching.\n",

      "  It is a great pleasure to be part of this celebration for the publication of this remarkable book, volume I of Allan Meltzer's History of the Federal Reserve. After what has surely been the most exhaustive examination to date of records of policy discussions at the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Allan has provided what is, by far, the most detailed analysis of Federal Reserve policy through the Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of 1951. But it also focuses on elements that the Federal Reserve System's founders perhaps could not have anticipated, including the early internal power struggles and the profoundly challenging economic and political events, which contributed to policy errors. It is no wonder that many of their initiatives went astray.Allan successfully weaves into the story the interaction of economic ideas with events and policy decisions and highlights how the prevalence of misperceptions and incorrect beliefs, perhaps induced by academic theories of the day, contributed to policy errors.

      " He observed: If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage.10One recent study of the effects of openness on growth demonstrated that when countries are divided into two groups--those with generally open economies and those with generally closed economies--open economies have experienced average growth that is 2 ½ percentage points higher than the growth of closed economies.11   Furthermore, when developing economies are ranked according to their historical record of openness, economies such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are near the top of the list.12   These Asian economies are some of the same ones that participated in the region's so-called growth miracle.For another example of a country that has benefited from free trade, we need look no further than Mexico--our host today. Stanley Fischer, for example, concluded that if a country with inflation of 10 percent becomes a country with inflation of 110 percent, its annual growth rate would fall 4 percentage points; the consequences of this for standards of living can hardly be overemphasized.17   This effect may help to explain why East Asia, where inflation has been relatively low on average, has been more successful than Latin America, where many countries have suffered bouts of hyperinflation.More generally, Latin America provides a good example of both the deleterious effects of macroeconomic instability and the benefits of putting sound policies in place.\n",

      " Irrespective of how deflationary forces might         influence it, our economy has the benefit of enhanced flexibility, which         has, at least to date, allowed us to withstand the potentially destabilizing         effects of some substantial negative shocks. Ironically, low inflation, economic stability, and low risk premiums         may provide tinder for asset price speculation that could be sparked should         technological innovations open up new opportunities for profitable investment. Among our realistically limited alternatives,         dealing aggressively with the aftermath of a bubble appears the most likely         to avert long-term damage to the economy.4Regardless of history's verdict on a policy that addresses only the aftermath         of bubbles, we still need to improve our understanding of the dynamics         of bubbles and deflation to contain the latter, if not the former. The list is rather impressive: First,         a halving of stock prices and household equity wealth; second, a dramatic         decline in capital expenditures; third, the tragic events of September         11; fourth, the disturbing evidence of corporate malfeasance; and fifth,         the recent escalation of geopolitical risks. Although our most probable forecast already was that growth         would pick up, we judged the cost of the insurance provided by additional         easing as exceptionally modest because we viewed the risk of an imminent         rise in inflation as remote.

      " Thus, judging from the data on the use of derivatives, the potential for financial innovation to have a broader impact and thereby to continue contributing to globalization appears considerable.Evidence of Financial Globalization in Capital FlowsImplicit in the criterion for complete globalization that opportunities for cross-border arbitrage disappear is that global savings should flow irrespective of location to investment in projects with the highest risk-adjusted rate of return.2A half-century ago, Harry Markowitz showed mathematically that an investor can reduce the variance, and hence the riskiness, of his portfolio for a given expected return by diversifying into assets with imperfectly correlated returns.3  Subsequent research showed that foreign assets are excellent candidates for diversification.4Direct barriers to capital flows, such as restrictions on foreign purchases of domestic assets and limitations on the ability of domestic residents to invest abroad, have promoted home bias, although, as I will discuss shortly, many such direct obstacles in recent decades have been mitigated. A clear benefit of financial globalization is that, to the extent that it reduces home bias, savings will be better directed to the most promising investments in the world, increasing global economic growth and prosperity. Argentina's recent default provided a powerful test of these new derivatives and proved their worth, perhaps even helping to limit contagion.The further development of derivatives markets, particularly in smaller economies where idiosyncratic risk may be more difficult to hedge, will likely facilitate greater cross-border flows and a more productive distribution of global savings.\n",

      " Meeting the goals, particularly in areas and among populations where biases and negative perceptions may have contributed to market failures, helps people improve their financial standing, regardless of their current economic status.For nearly four decades, numerous policies and programs have been implemented with the intent of increasing economic opportunity. The Federal Reserve Board's 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances concluded that between 1998 and 2001, families in the lowest quintile of the income distribution increased their rate of homeownership nearly 5 percent, saw their median income grow more than 14 percent, and realized a 25 percent gain in their median net worth. The absence of credible data clearly renders researchers unable to attribute the gains to a particular program or the continued challenges to a particular failure. But the lack of broad data management systems to identify and track the performance and profitability of most CRA-eligible loans presents researchers with a challenge, as does the need to focus on changes that can truly be attributed to the CRA, rather than to changing market forces.Information Gains in Community Development\tWhile empirical research on specific community development programs is limited, insights nonetheless have been gained from experience over the past several decades. In seeking to ensure continued financial support for their programs, community development leaders have expanded their range of financing and, in the process, have gained a better understanding of the risk tolerance and return requirements of their various capital providers.\n",

And to uphold our currency's soundness, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender and counterfeiting must be effectively thwarted. The Federal Reserve was founded nearly ninety years ago to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible and more stable monetary and financial system. This action, combined with aggressive law enforcement, is part of our ongoing commitment to protect our notes from counterfeiting. We check all older notes to determine if they are in good enough condition to be re-circulated. Since the average circulation life of a new $20 bill is only about two years, we expect that within a few years a high proportion of the $20s in circulation will be of the new series.All existing notes of course will continue to be legal tender. I am gratified that the last redesign of U.S. currency was a success and I trust we will repeat that success when we begin circulation of the new $20 notes later this year.

      " Those uncertainties, coupled with the lingering concerns that had been created by corporate governance scandals, were among the key factors causing the performance of the U.S. economy late last year and early this year to be lackluster.Risk spreads on corporate bonds peaked in the fall of 2002 at the highest levels observed in at least a decade. Economic activity perked up in late spring and then accelerated further this summer as tax cuts provided a substantial boost to the disposable incomes of households.For the third quarter as a whole, real GDP, our broadest measure of output, is reported to have increased 7-1/4 percent at an annual rate, the fastest quarterly rate of growth in nearly twenty years and obviously a pace not sustainable over the longer run. This outcome has been associated with a dramatic increase in profits despite little evidence of corporate pricing power.The explanations of the past two years' surge in productivity are wide-ranging.One hypothesis is that some of the increase represents a temporary rise in the level of productivity reflecting a view that an unusual amount of caution is leading businesses to press workers and facilities to a greater degree than can be sustained over the longer haul. But with tepid sales growth, uncertainty about the strength of future demand, and a fierce discipline exerted by financial markets, companies have been forced to search aggressively for ways to use resources more efficiently, to cut costs, and restore operating profit margins.\n",

      " Moreover, even though hourly labor compensation and profit margins were rising, prices were being contained, implying increasing growth in output per hour.2 As a consequence of the improving trend in structural productivity growth that was apparent from 1995 forward, we at the Fed were able to be much more accommodative to the rise in economic growth than our past experiences would have deemed prudent. As John Taylor has emphasized, in the face of an incipient increase in inflation, nominal interest rates must move up more than one-for-one.3 Perhaps the greatest irony of the past decade is that the gradually unfolding success against inflation may well have contributed to the stock price bubble of the latter part of the 1990s.4   Looking back on those years, it is evident that technology-driven increases in productivity growth imparted significant upward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to stock prices.5   At the same time, an environment of increasing macroeconomic stability reduced perceptions of risk. Following the Russian debt default in the autumn of 1998, for example, the FOMC eased policy despite our perception that the economy was expanding at a satisfactory pace and that, even without a policy initiative, it was likely to continue doing so.10   We eased policy because we were concerned about the low-probability risk that the default might trigger events that would severely disrupt domestic and international financial markets, with outsized adverse feedback to the performance of the U.S. economy.\n",

      " Less-comprehensive data suggest that the ratio of global debt and equity claims to trade has been rising since at least the beginning of the post-World War II period, though apparently at a more modest pace than in recent years.2 From an accounting perspective, part of the increase in the ratio of world gross claims to trade in recent years reflects the continued marked rise in tradable foreign currencies held by private firms as well as a very significant buildup of international currency reserves of monetary authorities. The associated increased layers of intermediation in our financial systems make it easier to diversify and manage risk, thereby facilitating an ever-rising ratio of both domestic liabilities and assets to GDP and gross external liabilities to trade.3  These trends seem unlikely to reverse, or even to slow materially, short of an improbable end to the expansion of financial intermediation that is being driven by cost-reducing technology. With the seeming willingness of foreigners to hold progressively greater amounts of cross-border claims against U.S. residents, at what point do net claims (that is, gross claims less gross liabilities) against the United States become unsustainable and deficits decline? To cite a short list:  (1) greater longevity, owing first to the widespread development of clean, potable water and later to rapid advances in medical technology;  (2) a universal system of education that enabled greatly increased social mobility;  (3) vastly improved conditions of work; and (4) the ability to enhance our environment by setting aside natural resources rather than having to employ them to sustain a minimum level of subsistence.\n",

This trend has persisted whether our competitive advantage came from the development of more efficient technologies in agriculture, textiles, and steel, or, more recently, from the design and fabrication of microprocessors and the harnessing of the human genome.

But any uncertainty about the clarity and fixity of the law adds to the risk of trade, which as I noted, is reflected in a higher real cost of capital.We in the United States endeavored to lessen legal uncertainty by embedding our most fundamental principles in a constitution, which we made difficult to amend. Another cause of product downsizing is that, as we moved the technological frontier forward and pressed for information processing to speed up, the laws of physics required the relevant microchips to become ever more compact.More generally, in the  realm of physical production, where scarce resources are critical inputs, each additional unit of output is usually more costly to produce than the previous one; that is, production, at least eventually, is characterized by increasing marginal cost. The demand for conceptual products is clearly impeded to a much smaller degree by rising marginal cost than is the demand for physical products.But regardless of its causes, conceptualization is irreversibly increasing the emphasis on the protection of intellectual, relative to physical, property rights.

Some have argued that purchases of U.S. Treasuries by Asian officials are holding down interest rates on these instruments, and therefore U.S. interest rates are likely to rise as intervention by Asian monetary authorities slows, ceases, or even turns to net sales. Ordinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in the dollar prices of our imported goods and services, because foreign exporters seek to avoid price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. The decline in home bias probably reflects an increased international tendency for financial systems to be more transparent, open, and supportive of strong investor protection.5   Moreover, vast improvements in information and communication technologies have broadened investors' vision to the point that foreign investment appears less exotic and risky. According to the aforementioned Federal Reserve study of current account corrections in developed countries, although the large majority of episodes were characterized by some significant slowing of economic growth, most economies managed the adjustment without crisis. Can market forces incrementally defuse a worrisome buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so?

On average over the past few years, the nation has a smaller cattle herd than it did threedecades ago, but beef production has risen more than 20 percent. The dairy herd is aboutthree-fourths the size that it was in the late 1960s, but the output of milk has increased more thanone-third. In the poultry business, the flock of hens has changed little, on net, but the poundage ofbroilers delivered to retail has risen spectacularly. In addition, a good part of the increased livestock productivity has come from increasedattention to the genetic traits of animals, and these improvements are likely to accelerate with therapid application of the recent advances in genomics to the livestock sector. However, foreign producers areadopting farming innovations rapidly as well, and efforts to increase the openness of world marketswill need to be maintained and intensified so that the full benefits of farm productivity gains can raisestandards of living worldwide. To sum up, the phenomenal gains in U.S. agricultural productivity of the past centurybrought profound benefits to all consumers, regardless of their connection to a farm, in the form oflower prices, better quality, and more choices at retail outlets.

      " In tandem with increasing globalization, monetary policy, to most observers, has becomeincreasingly effective in achieving the objective of price stability. Can market forces incrementally defuse a buildup in a nation's current account deficit andnet external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so? In a world economy that is sufficiently flexible, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates presumably would change to reestablish global balance.5 Should globalization continue unfettered and thereby create an ever more flexibleinternational financial system, history suggests that current account imbalances will be defused with modest risk of disruption. We have, I believe, a reasonably good understanding of why Americans have been able toreach farther into global markets, incur significant increases in debt, and yet fail to produce the disruptions so often observed as a consequence. To be sure, even with the increased flexibility implied in a paradigm of expandingglobalization and innovation, the combination of exceptionally low saving rates and historically high ratios of household debt to income can be a concern if incomes unexpectedly fall. Our fiscal prospects are, in my judgment, a significant obstacle to long-term stability because the budget deficit is not readily subject to correction by market forces that stabilize other imbalances. It is thus difficult to judge how significant a problem our relatively low gross domestic saving rate is to the future growth of an efficient capital stock. Although increased flexibility apparently promotes resolution of current account imbalances without significant disruption, it may also allow larger deficits to emerge before markets are required to address them.\n",

      "  I am honored to accept the Eisenhower medal, which symbolizes a program for advancingleadership around the world. Such a program and the civil values of understanding and peace that itespouses stand in stark contrast to the rising level of violence so evident today. The resilience of free societies and economies to threats has been mostnotable in recent years. In the aftermath of the terrorism of September 2001, fears were widespread thatinternational commerce would contract and the ever-widening globalization of most of the previoushalf-century would come to a halt. But the freeing of markets over the previousquarter-century had imparted a  flexibility and, hence, a resilience that enabled cross-bordercommerce to quickly stabilize and, by early 2002, to resume its expansion. On average, world standards of living are rising, in large part owing to theincreasing embrace of free markets, especially by populous and growing China and India. If we could not do so, goods and servicescould not be exchanged efficiently. Corporate scandals and evidence of fraud and malfeasance notwithstanding, the history ofever-rising standards of living in a world fearful of violence is extraordinary testimony to theresilience of free peoples engaged in commerce. As President Eisenhower opined during the heightof the Cold War, stating a view that remains applicable today, \"[W]e now stand in the vestibule of avast new technological age--one that, despite its capacity for human destruction, has an equalcapacity to make poverty and human misery obsolete.\"\n",

      "  One of the defining characteristics of the recent business expansion in the United States hasbeen the evident reluctance of corporate managers to expand spending and hiring aggressively inresponse to and in anticipation of continued cyclical growth. Judging by the pickup in capitalspending in recent quarters, businesses are becoming more confident in the strength and durability ofthe cyclical upturn. Their ability to boost outputwithout adding appreciably to their workforces, appears to have reflected a backlog of unexploitedcapabilities to enhance productivity with minimal capital investment, a delayed effect of the capitalgoods boom of the 1990s. Hence, at least froman accounting perspective, all of the 1.1 percent increase in the prices of final goods and servicesproduced in that sector during that period was the consequence of a rise in profit margins. As a consequence of record levels of refinancing in the second half of 2002 and the first halfof 2003--which, by our estimates, encompassed roughly 45 percent of the total value of homemortgages outstanding--MBS duration fell to exceptionally low levels. As mortgage and other long-term rates rebounded last summer, a consequence of rapidly improving economic conditions and thefading of deflationary concerns, refinancing fell sharply, removing most downward pressure onduration. Unlike 1994, there has been an appreciableincrease of market rates in anticipation of policy tightening, though history cautions that investors'anticipations of the cumulative magnitude of policy actions and their timing under such circumstancesare far from perfect. Should that judgment prove misplaced, however, the FOMC isprepared to do what is required to fulfill our obligations to achieve the maintenance of price stabilityso as to ensure maximum sustainable economic growth.\n",

      " It is thus heightened growth of output per worker that offers the greatest potential for boosting U.S. gross domestic product to a level that would enable future retirees to maintain their expected standard of living without unduly burdening future workers. As I have noted previously, the bipartisan policies of recent decades directed at deregulation and increasing globalization and the innovation that those policies have spurred have markedly improved our ability to channel saving to its most productive uses, and as a byproduct increased the flexibility and the resiliency of the U.S. economy. With slowed labor force growth, the amount of new equipment that can be used productively could be more limited, and the return to capital investment could decline as a consequence. For example, aside from suppressing economic growth and the tax base, financing expected future shortfalls in entitlement trust funds solely through increased payroll taxes would likely exacerbate the problem of reductions in labor supply by diminishing the returns to work. If we have promised more than our economy has the ability to deliver to retirees without unduly diminishing real income gains of workers, as I fear we may have, we must recalibrate our public programs so that pending retirees have time to adjust through other channels. Because curbing benefits once bestowed has proved so difficult in the past, fiscal policymakers must be especially vigilant to create new benefits only when their sustainability under the most adverse projections is virtually ensured.\n",

      " What turned out to be bad creditjudgments, especially in real estate, energy, and foreign credit markets,coupled with high interest rates and a deep recession, led to the assisted acquisitionsof almost 120 banks and the actual demise of about 1,250 of them between 1985and 1992. Only theinability of thrifts to sustain deposit inflows with the high rates of themid-1960s and the late 1970s, an important cause of the later thrift crisis,kept the eroding deposit rate ceilings from being eliminated until the 1980s. Thevision that the bank of the future would be essentially an underwriter ofdiverse credits has not come to pass, despite the continued growth ofsecuritization and syndication, because taking credit risk, the historic coreof banking, remains profitable for those that know how to manage iteffectively. The volatility of interest rates in1998 associated with the Asian crisis and the Russian default, as well ascautions from the regulatory community, also provided a useful early warning,and the memory of the painful losses of the late 1980s and early 1990scontributed importantly to the response of bank management. But, in myjudgment, better risk measurement and risk management were noticeably importantin moderating overall credit losses during the most recent recession and inestablishing the higher credit standards that have been so important in themost recent years. Bank ConsolidationTechnology has also facilitated consolidation inbanking by making it more efficient at the margin--or perhaps lessinefficient--for firms to become larger, more geographically dispersed, andbetter able to manage multiple business lines.\n",

      " Thepolicy change initiated under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker on thatSaturday morning in Washington rescued our nation's economy from a dangerous pathof ever-escalating inflation and instability. The Keynesian revolutionof the 1930s and its subsequent empirical application led many economists toaccept the view that through regulation, state intervention, and the macroeconomicmanagement of aggregate demand, government policies, including those of our nation'scentral bank, could improve on earlier efforts to achieve and maintain “fullemployment.”  By the 1960s, policymakers seemed to concentrate their short-runobjectives on maintaining a “high pressure” economy in the belief that such arecipe could virtually thwart economic contractions at little or no risk tolong-run stability and growth. The task is easier still as we remind ourselves ofthe stark difference between the long-term prospects of our economy now, in ourcurrent environment of stability, and then, a quarter-century ago, before thereforms of that October.In closing, Iapplaud President Poole and his colleagues for organizing this event to reflectupon that critical episode in our nation’s economic history.

      " But, unlike past concerns, the currentsituation reflects an increasing fear that existing reserves and productive crude oil capacity havebecome subject to potential geopolitical adversity. During the past decade,despite more than 250 billion barrels of oil extracted worldwide, net proved reserves rose in excessof 100 billion barrels. Nonetheless, growing uncertainties about the long-term security of world oil production, especiallyin the Middle East, have been pressing oil prices sharply higher. Thepresumption was that temporary increases in demand or shortfalls of supply would lead producers,with sufficient time to seek, discover, drill, and lift oil, or expand reservoir recovery from existingfields, to raise output by enough to eventually cause prices to fall back to the presumed long-termmarginal cost of extracting oil. Rising geopolitical concerns about insecure reserves andthe lack of investment to exploit them appear to be the key sources of upward pressure on distantfuture prices. However, the most recent runup in spot prices to nearly $55 per barrel, attributedlargely to the destructive effects of Hurricane Ivan, left the price for delivery in 2010 barely above itsAugust high. Unless oil prices fall back, some of the more oil-intensiveparts of our capital stock would lose part of their competitive edge and presumably be displaced,as was the case following the price increases of the late 1970s. But, obviously, the risk of more serious negativeconsequences would intensify if oil prices were to move materially higher.\n",

      " They have been disturbed particularly by the rising ratio ofhousehold debt to income and the precipitous decline in the household saving rate. The analystspoint out, correctly, that the ratio of household debt to disposable income has risen especiallysteeply over the past five years and, at 1.2, is at a record high. They argue that acollapse of such prices would expose large, recently incurred mortgage debt to decreasing values ofhome collateral. Even though some down payments are borrowed, it wouldtake a large, and historically most unusual, fall in home prices to wipe out a significant part of homeequity. Overall, while local economies may experience significant speculativeprice imbalances, a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the United States, givenits size and diversity. Despite the recent high debt-to-income ratios, at least some of which is more statistical thanreal, the ratio of households’ net worth to income has risen to a multiple of more than five afterhovering around four and one-half for most of the postwar period. The share of income committed by households for paying interest and principal on theirdebt is a useful measure of the likely inclination of households to default on their obligations whenthey suffer adversity, such as job loss or illness. In short, credit card debt-serviceratios have risen to some extent because households prefer credit cards as a method of payment,and hence, the increase does not necessarily indicate greater financial stress.\n",

      " * * *How far can the decline in home bias and the increase in the variance of current account balances be expected to proceed, and where will it lead?Current account imbalances, per se, need not be a problem, but cumulative deficits, which result in a marked decline of a country's net international investment position--as is occurring in the United States--raise more complex issues. A continued financing even of today's current account deficits as a percentage of GDP doubtless will, at some future point, increase shares of dollar claims in investor portfolios to levels that imply an unacceptable amount of concentration risk.This situation suggests that international investors will eventually adjust their accumulation of dollar assets or, alternatively, seek higher dollar returns to offset concentration risk, elevating the cost of financing of the U.S. current account deficit and rendering it increasingly less tenable. This is a reason that forecasting the exchange rate for the dollar and other major currencies is problematic.Our analytic difficulty is that the forces driving the current account deficit are more, perhaps far more, visible than those determining the ex ante financing of the deficit.

      " Combined with improvements in transportation networks, these developments have expanded the range of tradable goods and services that can be brought to each market and have enabled greater integration of the productive resources of national economies. As the dollar rose, gross operating profit margins of exporters to the United States increased even as trade and current account deficits in the United States widened markedly.2  But these deficits have continued to grow over the past three years despite a decline in the dollar, whose broadly weighted real index is now much of the way back to its previous low in 1995. For example, from early 2002 to early 2004, the dollar's exchange rate against the euro and sterling, on average, declined about 30 percent, yet dollar prices of imported manufactured goods from the European Union rose by only 9 percent, slightly more than dollar prices of U.S. manufactured goods during the same two years. Gains from increased currency hedging against the dollar since early 20024 may have enabled European exporters to tolerate a fall in operating profit margins beyond what they otherwise would have been able to tolerate. Although the limited response, to date, of import prices to the dollar's decline has likely forestalled a decline in U.S. real imports, the effect of the low pass-through of exchange rates into import prices on the nominal dollar value of imports, and thus on the trade balance, is more complex.\n",

      " To be sure, improved agricultural techniques and the expansion of trade beyond the largely self-sufficient feudal manor increased the division of labor and raised living standards and populations, but growth in both was glacial. What we now know as the rule of law--namely protection of the rights of individuals and their property--widened, encouraging people to increase their efforts to produce, trade, and innovate. One hears a good deal of Franz Joseph Haydn in the string quartets and symphonies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; yet to my ear, at least, Mozart rose to a plateau beyond anything Haydn and his contemporaries were able to reach. Malthus built his pessimistic vision on a notion that the long-evident forces of stagnation would persist:  A human population with a propensity to grow geometrically would be thwarted by limits to growth in the means of subsistence. Britain's heavily controlled economy, a carryover from the war, was under persistent stress as it encountered one crisis after another in the early postwar decades. The notion that the centrally planned Soviet economy was catching up with the West was, by the early 1980s, increasingly viewed as dubious, though the view was not fully discredited until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 exposed the economic ruin behind the Iron Curtain. But even earlier in the postwar decades, distortions induced by regulation were viewed as more and more disturbing in the developed world.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Because of deregulation, increased innovation, and lower barriers to trade and investment, cross-border trade in recent decades has been expanding at a far faster pace than GDP. Nonetheless, the worldwide dispersion of current account balances has risen since the early 1990s, even excluding the United States.4 Thus, the decline in home bias, or its equivalent, expanding globalization, has apparently enabled the United States to finance and, hence, incur so large a current account deficit. Can market forces incrementally defuse a buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so? Thus, even though the longer-term prospects for innovation and respectable U.S. productivity growth are encouraging, our productivity growth has rarely exceeded an average rate of 3 percent annually for any protracted period. To be sure, even with the increased flexibility implied in a paradigm of expanding globalization and innovation, the combination of exceptionally low saving rates and historically high ratios of household debt to income can be a concern if incomes unexpectedly fall. Our fiscal prospects are, in my judgment, a significant obstacle to long-term stability because the budget deficit is not readily subject to correction by market forces that stabilize other imbalances. In light of the uncertain link between saving and productivity growth, it is difficult to measure the exact extent to which our relatively low gross national saving rate will limit the future growth of an efficient capital stock.\n",

      " The need for safety and soundness supervision and regulation has been greatly reinforced in the past century to address the market distortions that are unavoidable consequences of the special benefits provided to banks, benefits that were promulgated because of the tensions between bank contributions to growth and concerns about banks' role in economic instability. Specifically, by doing what public policy intended--increasing credit availability to less creditworthy, often minority, borrowers--banks might be accused unfairly of discrimination by those who fail to connect risk to price or to evaluate rates in terms of risk measures.

      "  It is a pleasure to join this group that is dedicated to developing strategies for ensuring that opportunities for economic advancement are available to all Americans, including members of lower-income families and communities. I do not disparage benevolence, but I believe that one of the most enduring achievements of the CRA has been that lenders, often to their surprise, have found low-income community lending to be a normal extension of their outreach for profitable business. If communities are going to be empowered, they need hard evidence of their successes and, yes, hard evidence of their failures, which, as you know, can point the way toward success. One of your challenges then is to expand the information about the impact of your activities so that you can demonstrate the viability of your efforts and replicate local models of success for the benefit of other communities and families. Achieving the objective, particularly in areas and among populations where biases and negative perceptions may have contributed to market failures, helps people improve their financial standing, regardless of their current economic status. For example, the measures that affordable-housing organizations use could illustrate the extent to which their programs have, or have not, increased homeownership rates and property values, reduced crime, improved school performance, or spurred new private-sector investment in a disadvantaged neighborhood. While these systems are in the early stages, they are a critical step in advancing understanding of the community economic development finance field and in designing policies and practices that can improve economic opportunity for low-income families and neighborhoods.\n",

      " Reflecting a low short-term elasticity of demand, higher prices in recent months have slowed the growth of oil demand, but only modestly. The slowdown in the growth of demand coupled with expanded production, which the price firmness has induced, has required markets to absorb an increased pace of inventory investment. The inexorable rise in residential and utility use has priced the more marginal industrial gas users partially out of the market and has induced significant gains in gas efficiency among a number of gas users such as petroleum refineries, steel mills, and paper and board mills. But if history is any guide, should higher prices persist, energy use will over time continue to decline, relative to GDP.1   Long-term demand elasticities have proved noticeably higher than those that are evident short term. But investment to convert reserves to productive capacity has fallen short of the levels required to match unexpected recent gains in demand, especially gains in China. Over the past few years, notwithstanding markedly higher drilling activity, the U.S. natural gas industry has been unable to noticeably expand production, or to increase imports from Canada. Because international trade in natural gas has been insufficient to equalize prices across markets, U.S. natural gas prices since late 2002 have been notably higher, on average, than prices abroad, thereby putting significant segments of the North American gas-using industry in a weakened competitive position. The larger question, of course, is what will increased world trade in LNG and expanded U.S. import capacity do to currently uncompetitive natural gas prices in the United States?\n",

      " Therefore, it is essential that policymakers, regulators, bankers, researchers, and consumer groups remain fully engaged in monitoring developments in the consumer finance market and continually seek to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the financial services industry, including how well it serves lower-income and underserved consumers. Naturally, this growth in demand fostered increased competition for consumer credit, and, most important, the development of new intermediaries to supply it. Although commercial banks continued to finance merchants, manufacturers, and farmers, they were forced to turn more to consumer lending during the Depression, when their primary business sharply contracted. When consolidation occurs, it is not uncommon for the merger to result in de novo entry to take advantage of any inefficiencies or transition difficulties of the newly consolidated enterprise. Technological advancements have significantly altered the delivery and processing of nearly every consumer financial transaction, from the most basic to the most complex. For example, information processing technology has enabled creditors to achieve significant efficiencies in collecting and assimilating the data necessary to evaluate risk and make corresponding decisions about credit pricing. Where once more-marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit, lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately. Consumer advocates contend that the lack of flexibility in the models can result in the exclusion of some consumers, such as those with little or no credit history, or misrepresentation of the risk that they pose.\n",

      " Provided that options market illiquidity is not protracted (say more than a month), they could postpone transacting in those markets until liquidity returns, without exceeding their internal risk limits. Participants in the OTC derivatives markets typically manage their counterparty credit risks to dealers by transacting only with counterparties that are perceived to be highly creditworthy, by entering into legal agreements that provide for closeout netting of gains and losses, and with the exception of most exposures to the few Aaa-rated dealers, by agreeing to collateralize net exposures above a threshold amount. The Federal Reserve remains concerned that the stress tests that some large participants are using to evaluate potential losses in the event of a large participant's default do not fully capture the potential interaction of counterparty credit risk and market risk, especially in concentrated markets. A particular concern has been that, as credit spreads widen appreciably at some point from the extraordinarily low levels that have prevailed in recent years, losses to nonbank risk-takers could force them to liquidate their positions in credit markets and thereby magnify and accelerate the widening of credit spreads.2 A definitive evaluation of these concerns about nonbank risk-takers would require information on the extent of credit risk transfer outside the banking system and on the identities and risk-management capabilities of the entities to which the risk has been transferred. Thus, the  review suggests that banks and their supervisors need to be alert to the possibility that further slippage of credit terms could result in material increases in credit risk to banks, a material loss of market discipline on hedge funds, and a material increase in the potential for hedge fund leverage to adversely affect market dynamics.\n",

      " I am delighted to join in celebrating your achievements and promise. Before recent technologies enabled transactions to clear and settle virtually in real time, most of the vast volumes of trades were not legally binding for days. If the situation had been otherwise, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America would never have realized so high a standard of living. After the revelations of recent corporate malfeasance, the market punished the stock and bond prices of those corporations whose behaviors had cast doubt on the reliability of their reputations. But as our economy has grown, and our business units have become ever larger, de facto shareholder control has diminished. A generation from now, as you watch your children graduate, you will want to be able to say that whatever success you achieved was the result of honest and productive work, and that you dealt with people the way you would want them to deal with you. I do not deny that many appear to have succeeded in a material way by cutting corners and manipulating associates, both in their professional and in their personal lives. But material success is possible in this world, and far more satisfying, when it comes without exploiting others. A free market capitalist system cannot operate fully effectively unless all participants in the economy are given opportunities to achieve their best. If we succeed in opening up opportunities to everyone, our national affluence will almost surely become more widespread.\n",

      " As a consequence, market participants offer topurchase GSE debt at interest rates substantially lower than those required of comparably situatedfinancial institutions without direct ties to government.2  Given this advantage, which private competitorshave been unable to fully overcome, the housing-related GSEs have grown rapidly in recent years. Freddiestated in its 1993 annual report that \"in short, to achieve our earnings objective, we are striving toincrease our total portfolio at a rate faster than residential mortgage debt growth ... [and] generateearnings growth in excess of revenue growth through focused management of credit and operatingexpenses.\" As Fannie and Freddie increase in size relative to the counterparties to their hedgingtransactions, the ability of these GSEs to quickly correct a misjudgment in their complex hedgingstrategies becomes more difficult, especially when vast reversal transactions are required to rebalanceportfolio risks. Moreover, with theadditional capital available at banks to absorb the inevitable hedging misjudgments, reversals of fortuneare likely to create less disruption to the banking system relative to the disruption possible at Fannie andFreddie. Much of this increase seems to be due to growing incomes of households, agenerally lower level of interest rates, and an increased ability to extend loans to borrowers who requirehigher loan-to-value ratios. Combining a diversified pool of home mortgages into a single package in this way reduces the sum of the risks associated with the individual mortgages and enables the packager to sell claims against the package that pay interest rates below the average yield of the package as a whole.\n",

      " Reflecting a low short-term elasticity of demand, higher prices in recent months have slowed thegrowth of oil demand, but only modestly. That slowdown, coupled with expanded production alsoinduced by the price firmness, required markets to absorb an unexpected pickup in the pace ofinventory accumulation. The inexorable rise in residential and utility use has priced the more marginal industrial gas users partiallyout of the market and has induced significant gains in gas efficiency among a number of gas users, suchas petroleum refineries, steel mills, and paper and board mills. But if history is anyguide, should higher prices persist, energy use over time will continue to decline relative togross domestic product (GDP). With real energy prices again onthe rise, more-rapid decreases in the intensity of use in the years ahead seem virtually inevitable. We can expect similar increases in oil and energy efficiency in the rapidly growing economies ofEast Asia as they respond to the same set of market incentives. But investment to convert reserves to productive capacity has fallen short of thelevels required to match unexpected recent gains in demand, especially gains in China. Over the past few years, notwithstanding markedly higher drilling activity, the U.S. natural gasindustry has been unable to noticeably expand production or to increase imports from Canada.

      "  The pronounced decline in U.S. Treasury long-term interest rates over the past year despite a 200-basis-point increase in our federal funds rate is clearly without recent precedent. Moreover, despite the recent backup in credit risk spreads, yields for both investment-grade and less-than-investment-grade corporate bonds have declined even more than Treasuries over the same period. In March of this year, market participants once again bid up long-term rates, but as occurred last year, forces came into play to make those increases short lived. As the inevitable increases in retirement populations approach, especially among developed countries, the underfunding of retirement plans has become a growing concern. That improved performance has doubtless contributed to lower inflation-related risk premiums, and the lowering of these premiums is reflected in significant declines in nominal and real long-term rates. Whatever the underlying causes, low risk-free long-term rates worldwide seem to be one factor driving investors to reach for higher returns, thereby lowering the compensation for bearing credit risk and many other financial risks over recent years. To meet this demand, hedge fund managers are devising increasingly more complex trading strategies to exploit perceived arbitrage opportunities, which are judged--in many cases erroneously--to offer excess rates of return. Although collateralized debt obligations are a powerful tool for enhancing risk management by separating idiosyncratic risks from systematic risks, the models used to price and hedge these instruments are just beginning to be tested.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But concern that the monetary restraint of the 1950s had led to unnecessarily high unemployment persuaded the Federal Open Market Committee to adopt a more stimulative policy stance in the mid-1960s. Indeed, the insights from the work of Friedman and Schwartz a decade earlier gained greater prominence in the realm of practical policy.3 Most prominently, greater recognition of the importance of expectations suggested that those models, which for the most part incorporated autoregressive expectations, were excessively reduced-form and backward-looking in nature and thus insensitive to changes in economic structure and the policy process. The product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious threat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable scenario. The lowered risk premiums--the apparent consequence of a long period of economic stability--coupled with greater productivity growth have propelled asset prices higher.5  The rising prices of stocks, bonds and, more recently, of homes, have engendered a large increase in the market value of claims which, when converted to cash, are a source of purchasing power. Any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and, as a consequence, lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt that supported higher asset prices. The developing protectionism regarding trade and our reluctance to place fiscal policy on a more sustainable path are threatening what may well be our most valued policy asset:  the increased flexibility of our economy, which has fostered our extraordinary resilience to shocks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, I assume that these imbalances will be resolved before stark choices again confront us and that, if they are not, the Fed would resist any temptation to monetize future fiscal deficits. We had too much experience with the dangers of inflation in the 1970s to tolerate going through another bout of dispiriting stagflation. As part of that process, house turnover will decline from currently historic levels, while home price increases will slow and prices could even decrease. The surprisingly high correlation between increases in home equity extraction and the current account deficit suggests that an end to the housing boom could induce a significant rise in the personal saving rate, a decline in imports, and a corresponding improvement in the current account deficit. I presume maximum sustainable economic growth will continue to be our goal, with price stability pursued as a necessary condition to promote that goal. The configuration of asset prices is already an integral part of our evaluation of the large array of forces that influence financial stability and economic growth. Surely difficult challenges lie ahead for the Fed, some undoubtedly of our own making, and others that will be thrust on us by market or other forces. Having been exposed to the inner workings of this extraordinary institution for nearly two decades, I have little doubt that my successors, and theirs, will continue to sustain the leadership of the American financial system in an ever-widening global economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Some of the decade-long decline can be ascribed to expectations of lower inflation, a reduced risk premium resulting from less inflation volatility, and a smaller real term premium that seems to be due to a moderation of the business cycle over the past few decades. In similar fashion, Japanese investment exhibited prolonged restraint following the bursting of Japan's speculative bubble in the early 1990s, and investment in emerging Asia, excluding China, fell appreciably after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. According to data recently developed by Jim Kennedy of the Federal Reserve Board staff, and me, discretionary extraction of home equity accounts for about four-fifths of the rise in home mortgage debt.2 Our data splits home equity extraction net of closing costs, and hence debt increase on existing homes, into extraction from three sources:  (1) that associated with home turnover--that is, mortgage originations of buyers of existing homes less the associated debt cancellation of sellers, (2) refinancing cash-outs, and (3) increases in home equity loans. These products could be cause for some concern both because they expose borrowers to more interest-rate and house-price risk than the standard thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage and because they are seen as vehicles that enable marginally qualified, highly leveraged borrowers to purchase homes at inflated prices. The main reason for this negative relationship is likely that most people buying a home in California are probably also selling a home in California and using at least part of their accumulated home equity capital gains as a down payment on their new house.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But in periods of severe financial stress, such leverage too often brought down banking institutions and, in some cases, precipitated financial crises that led to recession or worse. The new instruments of risk dispersal have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks, in their credit-granting role, to divest themselves of much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far less leverage. We appear to be revisiting Adam Smith's notion that the more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct after inevitable, often unanticipated disturbances. It is important to remember that most adjustment of a market imbalance is well under way before the imbalance becomes widely identified as a problem. The impressive performance of the U.S. economy over the past couple of decades, despite shocks that in the past would have surely produced marked economic contraction, offers the clearest evidence of the benefits of increased market flexibility. And the economic fallout from the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was moderated by market forces, with severe economic weakness evident for only a few weeks. A decline in perceived risk is often self-reinforcing in that it encourages presumptions of prolonged stability and thus a willingness to reach over an ever-more-extended time period. Whatever the reason for narrowing credit spreads, and they differ from episode to episode, history cautions that extended periods of low concern about credit risk have invariably been followed by reversal, with an attendant fall in the prices of risky assets.\n",

      " As a consequence, the United States, then widely seen as a once-great economic power thathad lost its way, gradually moved back to the forefront of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renownedHarvard professor, had called \"creative destruction\"--the continual scrapping of old technologies tomake way for the innovative. Theadvent of innovative information technologies significantly shortened the reporting lag, enabling flexiblereal-time responses to emerging imbalances. But in periods of severe financial stress, suchleverage too often brought down banking institutions and, in some cases, precipitated financial crisesthat led to recession or worse. The new instruments of risk dispersal have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks, in theircredit-granting role, to divest themselves of much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far lessleverage. We appear to be revisiting Adam Smith's notion that the more flexible an economy,the greater its ability to self-correct after inevitable, often unanticipated disturbances. It is important to remember that most adjustment of a market imbalance is well under waybefore the imbalance becomes widely identified as a problem. The impressive performance of the U.S. economy over the past couple of decades,despite shocks that in the past would have surely produced marked economic contraction, offers theclearest evidence of the benefits of increased market flexibility. An increased capacity of management to discharge workers without excessive cost, for example,apparently increases companies' willingness to hire without fear of unremediable mistakes.\n",

      " In their aftermath, prices of crude oil worldwide moved sharply higher, and with refineries stressed by a shortage of capacity, margins for refined products in the United States roughly doubled. Reportedly appalled by the volatility of crude oil prices that stunted the growth of oil markets in the early years of the petroleum industry, Rockefeller had endeavored with some success to stabilize those prices by gaining control by the turn of the century of nine-tenths of U.S. refining capacity. At that point, the marginal pricing of oil, which for so long had been under the control of international oil companies, predominantly American, abruptly shifted to a few large Middle East producers and to greater market forces than those that they and the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could contain. Additionally, part of the decline in this ratio is due to improved energy conservation for a given set of economic activities, including greater home insulation, better gasoline mileage, more efficient machinery, and streamlined production processes. Subsequently, shocked by the increase in prices and without indigenous production to cushion the effects on incomes, Japan sharply curtailed the growth of its oil use, reducing the ratio of oil consumption to GDP by about half as well. Much of the innovation in oil development outside OPEC, for example, has been directed at overcoming an increasingly inhospitable and costly exploratory environment, the consequence of more than a century of draining the more immediately accessible sources of crude oil. This may already be happening in certain grades, given the growing mismatch between the heavier and more sour content of world crude oil production and the rising world demand for lighter, sweeter petroleum products.\n",

      " Thefirst was a deep concern that the problem of peacetime unemployment had not been solved. Keynes argued that the economy could get stuckat a point of inadequate aggregate demand and high unemployment and that deficit spending bythe government could provide the stimulus needed to reach and sustain a better equilibrium. Along those lines, perhaps the most important role of the CEA has been to scuttle manyof the more adventuresome ideas that inevitably bubble up through the machinery ofgovernment. However, many of them areill-advised and not well thought through and fail miserably the test of benefits exceeding costs. During the 1960s and 1970s, the economy was confronted by rising inflation pressures,a series of energy shocks, and a slowdown in the underlying pace of productivity growth. I should also note that, despite its overtly macroeconomic origins, theCEA has expanded successfully into the realm of microeconomics, particularly issues related toregulatory policy and market structure. It was a challenging time, and wedid not solve all the problems that we confronted. Objective and thorough analysis, as is the normat the CEA, is the most effective counterweight to this challenge. Because we had access to high-frequency data, we were able to see that thesharp further downturn in the economy in early 1975 reflected largely an inventory correctionand that final demand was holding up. Through all this history, the CEA has, in most cases,provided the President with the best economic advice available at the time and has, crucially,been a consistent advocate for the importance of market forces.\n",

Your efforts contribute directly to the Fed’s reputation as a credible, efficient central bank that can be depended upon, not just daily, but in times of crisis as well. When I think of all the great Texans I have known over the years, I inevitably recall the man you have chosen to honor with the naming of this building, my friend, confidant and golf partner, Edward W. Kelley, Jr.  I’ve known Mike Kelley since my first day at the Federal Reserve Board in 1987. And his perspective as a business executive was very valuable and clearly enriched our discussion on any number of topics. In retrospect, they apparently also contributed directly to the success of the System in crisis mode following the attacks. Additionally, during his tenure at the Board, Mike was instrumental in increasing the efficiency of the Federal Reserve System. Mike was the driving force behind the evolution that, now more than ever before, has the twelve regional Banks operating as a coordinated, seamless national system. For all of these reasons and more--I haven’t even gotten into stories from the golf course--it is with great pleasure that I help you dedicate this building to a man I have long admired, Mike Kelley.\n",

      "  Stability and Economic Growth: The Role of the Central Bank        International finance presents us with a number of intriguing anomalies,         but the one that seems to bedevil monetary policy makers the most as they         seek stability and growth (the topic of this conference) is the seemingly         endless ability of the United States to finance its current account deficit. To date, despite a current account deficit exceeding 6 percent of our         gross domestic product (GDP), we--or more exactly, the economic entities         that comprise the U.S. economy--are experiencing few difficulties in attracting         the foreign saving required to finance it, as evidenced by the recent         upward pressure on the dollar. The markets are not behaving in the way         that some, if not most, analysts anticipated as the U.S. current account         deficit rose above its previous high of 3-1/2 percent of GDP recorded         in 1986. Even if such returns on U.S. assets stay high, the         rise of concentration risks in foreign official and private portfolios         could still induce investors to slow their accumulation of dollar claims         and thereby delimit the size of the financeable U.S. current account deficit. That ex post relationship, the correlation between actual--instead         of intended--domestic saving and domestic investment was the object of         the seminal work by Feldstein and Horioka a quarter century ago.4         Without the evident worldwide fall in home bias over the past decade,         noted earlier, the United States would not have been able to finance its         recent current account deficits, and, accordingly, these deficits would         have been smaller.\n",

      " And, despite thedisruptions of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, economic activity appears to be expanding at areasonably good pace as we head into 2006. However, the positive short-term economic outlook isplaying out against a backdrop of concern about the prospects for the federal budget over the longerrun. The fundamental fiscal issue is the need to make difficult choices amongbudget priorities, and this need is becoming ever more pressing in light of the unprecedented number ofindividuals approaching retirement age. But because initial Social Security benefitsare heavily influenced by economywide wages, faster productivity growth will, with a lag, also raisebenefits under current law. The likelihood ofgrowing deficits in the unified budget is of especially great concern because the deficits would drain acorrespondingly growing volume of real resources from private capital formation and cast anever-larger shadow over the growth of living standards. Programs can always beexpanded in the future should the resources for them become available, but history has shown that theycannot be easily curtailed if resources later fall short of commitments. However, tax increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably posesignificant risks to economic growth and the revenue base. But solving that problem will do little in itself to meet the imperative to boost ournational saving. The challenge of Medicare is far more problematic than that associated with Social Security,mainly because of the large variance of possible outcomes mentioned earlier and the inadequacy of thecurrent medical information base.\n",

      " What is special about the past decade is that the decline in home bias, along with the rise in U.S. productivity growth and the rise in the dollar, has engendered a large increase by U.S. residents in purchases of goods and services from foreign producers. The dispersion of unconsolidated current account balances of individual economic entities relative to nominal GDP may be expected to exhibit similar trends to the dispersion of saving-investment imbalances among the seven consolidated nonfinancial sectors measured in U.S. macroeconomic statistics:  households, corporations, nonfarm noncorporate business, farms, state and local governments, the federal government, and the rest of the world.4  This measure exhibits a rise over the past half-century in the absolute sum of surpluses and deficits that is 1-1/4 percentage points per year faster than the rise of nominal GDP.5 The increase in the dispersion of the balances of unconsolidated economic entities was presumably even greater.6  Indeed, in a more detailed calculation employing more than five thousand nonfinancial U.S. corporations, the absolute value of surpluses and deficits as a ratio to a proxy for corporate value added exhibits an average annual increase of 3-1/2 percent per year.7 The apparent increase in the dispersion of the imbalances of the economic entities within our national borders appears to have flattened out over the past decade, according to calculations using the balances of the six domestic sectors. Implicit in a widening dispersion of current account surpluses and deficits of individual economic entities is the expectation of increasing cumulative deficits for some and, hence, a possible rise in debt as a share of their income.9  Unconsolidated debt of private nonfinancial U.S. entities as a ratio to GDP has, indeed, risen at nearly 3 percent per year, on average, over the past half-century.10  From 1900 to 1939, nonfinancial private debt rose almost 1 percent faster per year on average than GDP.\n",

      " The Federal Reserve had long made the distinction between \"productive\" and \"speculative\" uses of credit, and the rising stock market and the associated increases in bank loans to brokers were thus a major concern.3 Benjamin Strong, the influential Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a key protagonist in Friedman and Schwartz's narrative, had strong reservations about using monetary policy to try to arrest the stock market boom. Although not conducting a formal statistical analysis, Friedman and Schwartz gave a number of salient examples to show that the more tightly constrained a country was by the gold standard (and, by default, the more closely bound to follow U.S. monetary policies), the more severe were both its monetary contraction and its declines in prices and output. Indeed, since the large banks felt confident that the Fed would protect them if necessary, the weeding out of small competitors was a positive good, from their point of view.In short, according to Friedman and Schwartz, because of institutional changes and misguided doctrines, the banking panics of the Great Contraction were much more severe and widespread than would have normally occurred during a downturn. Thus, as I have always tried to make clear, my argument for nonmonetary influences of bank failures is simply an embellishment of the Friedman-Schwartz story; it in no way contradicts the basic logic of their analysis.Benjamin Strong and the Leadership VacuumFinally, what is probably Friedman and Schwartz's most controversial \"natural experiment\" stems from the premature death, in 1928, of America's preeminent central banker, Benjamin Strong.\n",

      " The enhanced importance of public beliefsand expectations about monetary policy in the region of price stability argues, it seems tome, for greater attention by the central bank to its methods of communication with thepublic in that region.On the premise that effective communication is even more crucial near pricestability, I will focus today on how an incremental move toward inflation targeting, in theform of the announcement of a long-run inflation objective, might help the Fedcommunicate better and perhaps improve policy decisions as well, without the costsfeared by those concerned about potential loss of flexibility. Because direct measures of the benefits of low inflation are notavailable, in practice papers in this literature estimate the OLIR to be the lowest inflationrate for which the risk of the funds rate hitting the lower bound appears to be “acceptablysmall.” Interestingly, the results using this approach seem fairly consistent acrossmodels and specifications, with several papers (including work using the FRBUS model,see Reifschneider and Williams, 2000) having concluded that the risk of hitting the zerobound seems to decline sharply once the long-run average inflation rate rises to about 2percent. Among other benefits, the announcement of the OLIRshould help participants in financial markets price long-term bonds and other financialassets more efficiently; help to lower inflation risk in financial markets and in other formsof contracting; and tend to stabilize long-term inflation expectations more broadly, whichin turn would make short-run stabilization policy more effective (Orphanides andWilliams, 2003).

      " Yet another benefit of full and timely release of information about policy decisions and their rationales is a reduced risk that market-sensitive information will dribble out through inappropriate channels, giving unfair advantage to some financial market participants. The fact that market expectations of future settings of the federal funds rate are at least as important as the current value of the funds rate in determining key interest rates such as bond and mortgage rates suggests a potentially important role for central bank communication:  If effective communication can help financial markets develop more accurate expectations of the likely future course of the funds rate, policy will be more effective (in a precise sense that I will explain further soon), and risk in financial markets should be reduced as well. A leading example is the stagflationary period of the 1970s, in which astute observers recognized that high and unstable public expectations of inflation, themselves generated by poor macroeconomic policies that allowed inflation to get out of control, greatly increased the complexity and cost of restoring stability.4  More recently, Marvin Goodfriend (1993) has identified several instances of what he calls \"inflation scares,\" apparently autonomous increases in inflation expectations that raised long-term bond yields and forced a tightening of monetary policy that could have been avoided if expectations had been better anchored. Unfortunately, as stressed by Poole (2003) as well as by Chairman Greenspan (2003) in his talk at the most recent Jackson Hole conference, specifying a complete and explicit policy rule, from which the central bank would never deviate under any circumstances, is impractical.\n",

      " Differences across countries in the nature and strength of the monetary policy transmission mechanism are another factor that may reduce the attractiveness of a monetary union.4   However, some more recent assessments, which have emphasized factors such as the high propensity of European countries to trade with each other and the increased coherence of national business cycles within Europe, have generally been more favorable (Alesina, Barro, and Tenreyro, 2002; Agresti and Mojon, 2001). However, cyclical conditions and the early weakness of the new currency no doubt played a critical role in that increase, an inference confirmed by the substantial slowing in European export growth since the beginning of 2001. Ireland was also unable to resort to monetary restraint to cool down an economy that, for a variety of reasons, was experiencing faster demand growth than most of the rest of Europe.8   Ireland's relatively high inflation rate may in turn have had destabilizing effects, because, in combination with low pan-European nominal interest rates, it implied that the Irish economy faced a negative real rate of interest. Today the spreads paid by these governments are quite small, in the vicinity of 15 basis points over the German equivalent for Italy and essentially zero for Spain.9   Clearly, these governments have benefited substantially by the reduction in inflation risk and exchange rate risk provided by the common currency.10   The addition of some sovereign default risk (now relevant because individual countries are no longer able to inflate away their debts) has evidently not offset these benefits, perhaps because of the effects of the Stability and Growth Pact.\n",

      " For comparison, between 1973 and 1975, in what was perhaps the most severe U.S. recession of the World War II era, real output fell 3.4 percent and the unemployment rate rose from about 4 percent to about 9 percent. In contradiction to the prevalent view of the time, that money and monetary policy played at most a purely passive role in the Depression, Friedman and Schwartz argued that \"the [economic] contraction is in fact a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces\" (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963,          p. 300). To support their view that monetary forces caused the Great Depression, Friedman and Schwartz revisited the historical record and identified a series of errors--errors of both commission and omission--made by the Federal Reserve in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Drawing on their historical evidence about the effects of money on the economy, Friedman and Schwartz argued that the declines in the money stock generated by Fed actions--or inactions--could account for the drops in prices and output that subsequently occurred.2 Friedman and Schwartz emphasized at least four major errors by U.S. monetary policymakers. Some viewed the Depression as the necessary purging of financial excesses built up during the 1920s; in this view, slowing the economic collapse by easing monetary policy only delayed the inevitable adjustment. First, critics wondered whether the tightening of monetary policy during 1928 and 1929, though perhaps ill advised, was large enough to have led to such calamitous consequences.3    If the tightening of monetary policy before the stock market crash was not sufficient to account for the violence of the economic downturn, then other, possibly nonmonetary, factors may need to be considered as well.\n",

      " They understand that they make crucial contributions to the policymaking process, not only in the realm of monetary policy but in banking, payments, consumer affairs, and other areas, and they bring great pride and professionalism to their work. Moreover, they understand the value of sophisticated and subtle economic analysis, which they apply both to day-to-day questions of policy and to more fundamental research questions. In their times at the Board, Dale Henderson, Dick Porter, and Peter Tinsley, each in his own way, have promoted a culture that combines the best in policy-oriented research with the intellectual rigor and curiosity needed to address questions that go beyond the immediate economic situation. Forecasting the direction of successful research is inherently very difficult. So I think the best I can do is highlight three general areas in which much good work has already been done, including research by Messrs. Henderson, Porter, and Tinsley, but in which further progress would be enormously helpful to monetary policymaking in practice. We have learned a great deal in recent years about the effects of monetary policy in dynamic, stochastic, sticky-price models, with Michael Woodford's recent book (Woodford, 2003) perhaps best representing the state of the art. Because monetary policy works with a lag, the ability of policymakers to stabilize the economy depends critically on our ability to peer into our cloudy crystal balls and see something resembling the future. Because good forecasts are so crucial to good monetary policy, I hope and expect to see a great deal more work exploring the robustness of alternative forecasting methods.\n",

      " Thus, if each of us focuses our efforts on just a few types of production and then trades our output with others, we can enjoy a far more varied and abundant supply of goods and services than we could if each person remained an isolated economic unit.2   Moreover, specialization tends to encourage innovation and hence promotes dynamism and growth as well as efficiency. The Union won the Civil War in large part because its blockade of Southern ports prevented the Confederacy from exporting its cotton, and the outcomes of both World War I and World War II turned on the fact that Great Britain and its allies were able to disrupt German trade more successfully than Germany's submarines could impede the flow of goods into and out of Great Britain. Research suggests, however, that because this number includes temporary layoffs, seasonal closings, and other job losses that are reversed within the year, it overstates longer-term job losses by about double (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh, 1996). Productivity gains of 3.8 percent in 2001, 6.4 percent in 2002, and 5.8 percent in 2003 (as reported by the BLS) have permitted U.S. manufacturers to reach levels of production only about two percent below the cyclical peak in mid-2000, despite the sharp decline in employment.12   The general trend toward higher productivity and decreased employment in manufacturing has been observed for decades in the United States, although the process has recently intensified.\n",

      "  Good morning and welcome to the Board Room. A little more than two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee gathered at this table and debated the future course of monetary policy. I wouldn't contradict that assumption, but there is a sense in which our topic today--the financial education of our young people--is even more important. Our economy can become ever more prosperous and our financial system ever more sophisticated, but if our young people lack the knowledge with which to make wise choices--for their present and their future--they will not be able to share in the benefits of the advancing economy and financial system. I say this not only from the perspective of a Federal Reserve policymaker, but as a former economics professor, a former member of the Montgomery Township, New Jersey, school board, and, most importantly, as the current parent of two young adults. And, I know many others join me in the conviction that financial education is crucial. If we are to succeed in spreading financial knowledge, educators and others must empirically analyze knowledge gaps and the results of their efforts to fill them. Fortunately, this body of research is growing. The survey (26 KB PDF) assessing high school         students' financial knowledge that the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal         Financial Literacy is releasing today is a very useful contribution to         that research.\n",

      " All else equal, the likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an underestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk premium.3   Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further complicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation. As the supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may push down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation.5 A separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS returns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers are more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices. For example, when nominal Treasury yields swung sharply during the spring and summer of 2003, ten-year breakeven inflation moved sharply as well, declining about 40 basis points as the bond market rallied, then rising about 80 basis points when nominal yields came back up (top panel). In 1989, James Stock and Mark Watson proposed a new index of leading indicators based on seven variables with exceptionally good forecasting track records up to that date. In particular, Piazzesi and Swanson (2004) find that if analysts ignore risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures, they will estimate longer-horizon policy expectations that \"lag behind\" actual market expectations, remaining too high when the Fed is easing and too low when the Fed is tightening.15    Fortunately, this research also shows how to correct the futures data to account for the time variation in risk premiums.\n",

      " Unlike some earlier periods, during which political refugees made up a larger share of the inflow of migrants to the United States, most immigrants today come for economic reasons, driven by the hope of making better lives for themselves and their families. Even more impressive, when we consider the limited financial resources of most immigrants, is the rate of entrepreneurship among the foreign-born; at 10 percent, this rate is nearly equal to the 11 percent rate of business ownership of people born in this country (Camarota, 2002). As we discuss the barriers that immigrants must overcome to achieve full integration into American society, we should keep in mind that virtually all of us here are immigrants, even if at some remove. Only by using such institutions will immigrants successfully expand their range as entrepreneurs, become homeowners, build credit histories, save for retirement, and insure against financial and other risks. Remittance flows to developing countries typically exceed official development assistance, are similar in magnitude to foreign direct investment, and are more stable than either of these other flows. Nonbank providers of remittance services vary greatly in quality, and in some cases nonbanks can provide better service or greater convenience than banks can.

The balance sheets of mosthouseholds are in good shape: Perhaps most important, the ratio of householdnet worth to income is relatively high, not far below its pre-recession level.Also, households took advantage of low long-term rates during the last cycle toreduce their exposure to short-term and high-interest debt. This increase in the participation rate would imply a totalincrease in the labor force (including the portion attributed to the rise inpopulation) of some 350,000 people and hence a need for more than 330,000 netnew jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising. Second, I see little evidence (for example, in the job flows data)to suggest that the pace of structural change today is greater than it wasafter the 1990-91 recession or in the expansion of the mid- to late-1990s.Third, factors affecting labor supply and the efficiency of job matching,including demographic changes, greater worker experience and education,increases in incarceration rates, increases in disability rolls, increased useof temporary help firms, and increased job search through the Internet, suggeststrongly that the sustainable rate of unemployment has steadily declined since themid-1980s, to a level below the current rate.\n",

      " Today I will focuson three of these: (1) Policymakers' uncertainty about the economy should leadto more gradual adjustment of the policy rate; (2) gradualism in adjusting thepolicy rate affords policymakers greater influence over the long-term interestrates that most affect the economy; and (3) gradualism reduces risks tofinancial stability. Overshooting the objective of stable, non-inflationary growth is perceivedas costly by policymakers because overshooting creates unnecessary volatilityin the economy and delays the achievement of macroeconomic stability. Similar considerations presumably played a role during the1994-95 tightening cycle, when concerns that inflation might rise significantlyinduced a relatively more rapid tightening. For example,some researchers have argued that gradual adjustment of short-term rates givescommercial banks more time to adjust to changes in the costs of short-termfunding and thereby increases the stability of bank profits (Cukierman, 1991).Slow adjustment of short-term rates may reduce financial stress for othereconomic actors as well--for example, households with adjustable-rate mortgagesand businesses with heavy needs for short-term financing. According to this argument,sharp changes in the policy rate risk creating large capital gains and lossesfor bondholders, which increase market volatility and pose risks for banks andother financial institutions that hold bonds. Other factors likely to keep inflation at modestlevels include continuing rapid gains in productivity, which have kept growthof unit labor costs at a very low level; unusually high price-cost margins inindustry, which provide scope for firms to absorb future cost increases withoutraising prices; globalization and intensified competition in product markets;and the recent strengthening of the dollar.\n",

      " Home-Host: Global Banking, International Consensus, and Sovereign CountriesBanks with significant cross-border operations have understandable concerns about the prospect of each national supervisor asking different questions about Basel II implementation, demanding different data, applying the rules differently, or taking other actions that increase cost or are inconsistent with the principle of consolidated supervision. At the outset--and at the risk of feeding your worst fears--let me remind you of the broad context in which we are working. Three aspects of Basel II may raise the level of tension experienced by internationally active banks still further:  (1) Basel II is more complex, (2) it includes requirements for capital to cover operational risk, and (3) it has all the uncertainties of the new and untested. Host-country supervisors face the costs of adjusting to differences in the manners in which foreign banks will implement Basel II, while the banks and home-country supervisors worry about host-supervisor intrusions, questions, and special rules. A foreign bank under the foundation approach at home but under the advanced approach in the United States would have to determine two variables in the United States for its corporate exposures that would not be required of its consolidated entity: loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). Moreover, any shortfalls in systems will have to be disclosed under Pillar 3; and we reserve the right, under Pillar 2, to require additional capital during the transition to full implementation.\n",

      " Becauseof these changes in their outlook, market participants now expect the FOMC to proceedmore slowly in its tightening than they did in June.1Moreover, with inflation now expected to remain low, market participants mayanticipate a lower short-term interest rate to prevail in the long run. By guiding market expectations in this way, thepolicy committee attains increased influence over the most economicallyrelevant long-term yields, reduced financial and economic uncertainty, and, inall probability, better economic outcomes. However, this market reaction placedinsufficient weight, I believe, on the fact that the expansion that began inmid-2003 was characterized by exceptional gains in labor productivity, whichimplied in turn that the rapid growth in output did not materially increase thepressure on resources. Some EvidenceIn my remarks thusfar I have argued in general terms that FOMC communication can help inform thepublic's expectations of the future course of short-term interest rates,providing the Committee with increased influence over longer-term rates and hencea greater ability to achieve its macroeconomic objectives. However,as most rate actions are well anticipated by financial markets, changes in thefederal funds rate alone account for only a small portion of the change inexpectations around FOMC decisions.7Over the short period around a policy decision, FOMC statements, not therate-setting action itself, have the greater influence on year-ahead rateexpectations, particularly when the content of the statement is not fullyanticipated by market participants.8For example, according to our estimates, a policy statement that surprises themarket leads market participants to revise their year-ahead rate expectations about14 basis points more than they would have in the absence of such a statement.\n",

      " In 1979, most economists would have agreed that,in principle, low inflation promotes economic growth and efficiency in the longrun. Expectationsof high inflation lead to more-aggressive wage and price demands, which makeachieving and maintaining low inflation more difficult and costly (in terms oflost output and employment) for the central bank. The benefit of appointing a hawkish central banker isthe increased inflation-fighting credibility that such an appointment brings.The public is certainly more likely to believe an inflation hawk when hepromises to contain inflation because they understand that, as someone who isintrinsically averse to inflation, he is unlikely to renege on his commitment.As increased credibility allows the central bank to achieve low inflation at asmaller cost than a non-credible central bank can, the president may well find,somewhat paradoxically, that he prefers the economic outcomes achieved underthe hawkish central banker to those that could have been obtained under acentral banker with views closer to his own and those of the public. Alternatively,because central banks may possess the greater expertise in determining whateconomic outcomes are both feasible and most desirable, macroeconomic goalsmight be set through a joint exercise of the government and the central bank.Many countries have established targets for inflation, for example, and centralbankers in those countries evidently make strong efforts to attain thosetargets. Those who discount this concern argue that changing thecontract in midstream would be costly for the government, because laws onceenacted are difficult to modify and because changing an established frameworkfor policy in an opportunistic way would be politically embarrassing.\n",

      " The capital inflows, the stronger dollar, and the associated rise in imports worked together to permit increased capital investment in the United States during that period, enabling production and incomes to grow without overheating the economy or requiring a sustained rise in interest rates. But even those most concerned about potential instability in international capital flows would have to admit that comprehensive capital controls, if applied for any extended period, might solve one problem at the cost of creating a more serious one--namely, the inhibition of growth and development that occurs when nations lack access to international capital markets. Indeed, some studies have concluded that even the United States and the European Union, the largest currency unions, are themselves not optimum currency areas.5   Plausibly, political rather than economic considerations--namely, the desire to form a more perfect union--underlay the decisions of each of these entities to adopt a common currency.6 , 7 Besides countries well-suited for a currency union, a second group of countries that might conceivably be better off with a fixed exchange rate, at least for a time, are the very poorest and least developed countries, which may lack the institutional infrastructure to effectively operate an independent monetary policy. One traditional argument in favor of fixed exchange rates for developing countries focuses on their usefulness in so-called heterodox programs for overcoming high inflation.8   According to this view, the advantage of fixing the exchange rate as one element of an anti-inflation program (along with fiscal reforms and other policy changes) is that fixing the rate is more visible, more credible, and easier to explain than a commitment to stabilizing prices directly.\n",

      " It is thus somewhat puzzling that the othertwo indicators of speculative activity do not appear to be present: Our best-availablemeasure of speculative traders' holdings of contracts for future delivery ofcrude oil and petroleum products has decreased from earlier in the year and isnot unusually high by historical standards.9And official data imply that physical inventories of crude oil and petroleumproducts, at least within the industrial countries for which we have good data,have not risen to any significant degree and at times have even been belowseasonal norms.10Perhaps the official data overlook important accumulations of crude oilstocks--in China and other emerging-market economies, for example--but thatremains (if you will excuse the expression) speculation. The general idea is that, if most pricesadjust slowly, the effects of an excessively easy monetary policy will show upfirst as a sharp increase in those prices that are able to adjust most quickly,such as the prices of commodities (including oil). Thesepredictions include (1) that all commodity prices should move proportionally inresponse to changes in monetary policy (in fact, oil prices have risen sharplysince the spring as other commodity prices have generally stabilized); (2) thatthe dollar should have rapidly depreciated as the oil price rose (in fact, thedollar has been broadly stable during 2004); (3) that inflation expectationsshould have increased substantially (but long-term nominal interest rates, thelevel of inflation compensation implicit in inflation-indexed bond yields, andsurvey measures of inflation expectations concur in showing no such rise); and(4) that general inflation, though lagging commodity-price inflation, shouldalso rise over time (but inflation excluding energy prices remains quite low). Along with the rise in oil prices,increases in the prices of other important commodities, such as steel andlumber, as well as higher import prices resulting from the earlier decline inthe dollar, provided supply-side pressure on inflation in early 2004.Meanwhile, an economic expansion that took hold in the middle of 2003 resultedin strong output growth but, as of early this year, limited progress increating new jobs.\n",

      " Although the dress code continues to be a drawback, I am pleased to be able to report that the intellectual challenges of my new job have been as rewarding as those I encountered as an academic. Deposit insurance and other government protections reduce the risk of banking instability but create the potential for moral hazard and other problems. The challenge for bank supervisors is to ensure the safety and soundness of banking institutions--that is, to minimize moral hazard and to protect the deposit insurance fund--without inhibiting economically valuable activities or technological innovation by banks. Designing regulations to accomplish these objectives has become markedly more difficult as banking organizations have become larger and more complex. The new Basel II international capital accord, which the Fed helped to design in collaboration with other banking regulators from the United States and around the globe, may well be the most economically sophisticated regulation scheme ever devised.1    The new system is designed to use information provided by the banks themselves about their loss experience, together with algorithms that mimic the most up-to-date risk-management techniques, to establish minimum capital standards for banks that approximate the appropriate level of economic capital. It is, nevertheless, an intellectually challenging activity--analogous, it seems to me, to the efforts of a detective to reconstruct a sequence of events from a range of diverse and subtle clues--and I have enjoyed the opportunity to become more proficient at it.\n",

Second, qualifying the first conclusion, the rangeof uncertainty in forecasts of productivity growth is inevitably quite wide.For example, a 2004 study by three leading scholars produced an estimate oftrend productivity growth of 2.6 percent, but with a range of plausibleoutcomes between 1.4 percent and 3.2 percent (Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2004).This qualification naturally leads us to ask: Suppose that, over the next year,the incoming evidence suggests that the trend rate of productivity growth is eithersubstantially higher or substantially lower than we currently expect. As a number of analysts have noted, under thereasonable assumption that nominal wages adjust slowly, slower productivitygrowth results in a more rapid rise in unit labor costs (the nominal-wage costof producing a unit of output).8All else equal, a more rapid increase in unit labor costs will tend to increaseinflation as well.\n",

      " These are challenging questions of monetary economics and political economy, and their answers have important implications for the economic future of the Western Hemisphere--including the United States, which stands to benefit greatly from increased trade with and investment in a more prosperous Latin America. Ironically, the poor often were among those most hurt by extreme populist policies because they were the most vulnerable to rising unemployment and real-wage declines and the least able to protect themselves against inflation.5 Latin America's macroeconomic problems reached their apogee during the so-called Lost Decade of the 1980s. Nevertheless, during the past fifteen years or so, both the political elites and the broader public in the region have, for the most part, shown an increased willingness to abandon the failed economic models of earlier decades in favor of new approaches that emphasize improved fiscal discipline, the benefits of free trade and free markets, and the vital importance of building strong economic institutions. With the benefit of hindsight, many economists would now agree that exchange-rate pegs, if combined with other policy measures such as fiscal consolidation, can be useful in the transition from high to low inflation.6   However, a key lesson of the recent experience is that fixed exchange rates are generally not a long-run solution to problems of monetary and fiscal instability, at least not in a world of high capital mobility. For example, inflation is typically more difficult to control in developing economies than in the industrialized economies because of the greater influence of exchange-rate fluctuations, the heavy weight of volatile food and commodity prices in the consumer basket, and the volatility of the public's inflation expectations resulting from a history of high and unstable inflation.\n",

      " Despite the growth in employment, however, the unemployment rate should decline relatively slowly, as a strengthening job market attracts people back into the labor force. However, despite the decline in the dollar of the past two years, core import prices excluding fuels rose only 2-1/2 percent in the second half of 2004 and increases could well continue to be moderate.2   The pass-through of the effects of the declining dollar on import prices has remained remarkably low, all things considered. Evidence that the labor market is not yet at its potential includes subdued wage growth, the failure thus far of labor participation rates to increase from cyclical lows, the relatively large number of people who say they are working part-time for economic reasons, and the impression gleaned from surveys and anecdotes that the supply of potential employees in most occupations remains plentiful. In summary, with all the caveats mentioned today firmly in mind, I look for 2005 to be a good year for the U.S. economy:  real growth at 3-3/4 percent or slightly better, core PCE inflation in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, and a slowly declining unemployment rate. Some of the more obvious possibilities include oil supply disruptions that send the price of crude much higher, a slowdown in foreign economic growth that reduces the demand for U.S. exports, or the realization that less economic slack remains than I currently believe, which would increase the risk of higher inflation.\n",

      " To be more specific, I will argue that over the past decade a combination of diverse forces has created a significant increase in the global supply of saving--a global saving glut--which helps to explain both the increase in the U.S. current account deficit and the relatively low level of long-term real interest rates in the world today. One popular argument for the \"made in the U.S.A.\" explanation of declining national saving and the rising current account deficit focuses on the burgeoning U.S. federal budget deficit, which in 2004 drained more than $400 billion from the national saving pool. The development and adoption of new technologies and rising productivity in the United States--together with the country's long-standing advantages such as low political risk, strong property rights, and a good regulatory environment--made the U.S. economy exceptionally attractive to international investors during that period. As U.S. business investment has recently begun a cyclical recovery while residential investment has remained strong, the domestic saving shortfall has continued to widen, implying a rise in the current account deficit and increasing dependence of the United States on capital inflows.9 According to the story I have sketched thus far, events outside U.S. borders--such as the financial crises that induced emerging-market countries to switch from being international borrowers to international lenders--have played an important role in the evolution of the U.S. current account deficit, with transmission occurring primarily through endogenous changes in equity values, house prices, real interest rates, and the exchange value of the dollar.\n",

      " The FOMC's decisions are guided by the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress, which enjoins the Committee to use its powers to pursue both price stability and maximum sustainable employment. For example, low mortgage rates promote increased spending on new homes, low auto-financing rates tend to increase the sales of new cars, and low corporate bond yields and high stock prices generally induce firms to invest in new capital goods, such as factories and machines, at a faster pace. When theeconomy is growing too sluggishly to fully employ its capital and laborresources, and if insufficient aggregate demand is the cause of slow growth,increased financial stimulus can help return the economy to full employment byexpanding the aggregate demand for goods and services. In the face of large and often unpredictable payments flows, a financially-active bank must confront the problem of managing its reserve account both to meet its reserve requirement for the period and also to avoid ending any day with its account at the Fed overdrawn (which may carry a financial penalty). For example, to increase the supply of reserves, the Open Market Desk purchases securities (usually government securities) on the open market, crediting the seller with an increase in reserve balances on deposit at the Fed in the amount of the purchase.9 Thus, a purchase of a billion dollars' worth of securities by the Open Market Desk increases the supply of funds available to lend in the fed funds market by the same amount. For example, mortgage rates are closely linked to long-term Treasury yields, the spread between the tworates being explained largely by factors such as the risk of default onmortgage loans and the so-called prepayment risk (that is, the risk thathomeowners will choose to pay off their mortgages early).\n",

      " Specifically, some influential voices of the time argued that, by accepting higher inflation, policymakers could bring about a permanently lower rate of unemployment.2 As I will discuss a bit later, the demise of the view that higher inflation promotes employment in favor of the modern consensus that low inflation and strong employment are complementary goals resulted from the constructive interplay between academic research and practical policymaking experience, an interplay that significantly improved policy outcomes and economic welfare in the United States. Nevertheless, I am confident that the effect is positive and see the international experience as at least consistent with the view that, in combination with other sound policies, the maintenance of price stability has quite significant benefits for efficiency and growth. The Fed, attempting to gain control of the deteriorating inflation situation, raised interest rates sharply; however, initially at least, these increases proved insufficient to control inflation or inflation expectations, and they added substantially to the volatility of output and employment. In his 1977 Nobel Prize address, Friedman laid out the modern argument--that, because it harms the efficient operation of markets, high inflation is more likely to raise unemployment than to lower it--and he used the experience of the 1970s to illustrate his point.6 Indeed, by the late 1970s, even economists who were not part of Friedman's monetarist circle were beginning to study and acknowledge the costs to the economy associated with high inflation.7 When Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker embarked on his campaign to break the back of U.S. inflation in October 1979, he drew on this existing work in formulating and defending his program.\n",

I know also that I can rely on the enormous strengths of this institution: excellent leadership on the Board and in the Reserve Banks and unmatched expertise and experience in the staff.

      " Average return on equity (ROE), for example, following a decline associated with the 2001 recession, remains solid and indeed has shown a slight upward trend. Consistent with this view, community bank capital ratios remain impressively high, and community banks' ability to attract deposits continues to be a source of strength. Although bank merger activity has generally declined since the late 1990s, at least 200 deals were completed in each year from 2000 through 2005. Indeed, part of the success of nondepository institutions may have been due to the fact that the median distance between a small-business customer and its nondepository service provider fell from 83 miles in 1998 to 37 miles in 2003, with most of the change resulting from greater proximity of customers to nondepository loan providers. New technologies and management methods have eroded some of the traditional informational benefits of relationship finance, however, and community banks have lost market share to larger banks and to nondepository institutions. In recent years, community banks have become more focused on commercial real estate lending, leading to a significant shift in the balance sheet and risk profiles of growing numbers of banks. Thus far, the relative stability of community bank net interest margins suggests that they have done a good job of managing their interest rate risk exposure throughout the recent increase in market rates. With the banking system enjoying a period of relatively high liquidity, now is a good time for all companies to assess the adequacy of their processes for managing liquidity risk.\n",

      " The goal, as you know, was to help ensure that the economic expansion would be self-sustaining and to protect against a remote risk that the fall in inflation observed during 2003 might culminate in outright deflation--an outcome that could have had potentially serious consequences for the economy and for the efficacy of monetary policy. According to several of the most popular models, a substantial portion of the decline in distant-horizon forward rates over recent quarters can be attributed to a drop in term premiums.2 Using some of these models, we can further divide the term premium into two parts--a premium for bearing real interest rate risk and a premium for bearing inflation risk. First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally. I have argued elsewhere that improved monetary policies, which stabilized inflation and better anchored inflation expectations, are an important reason for this positive development; no doubt, structural changes in the economy such as deregulation, improved inventory control methods, and better risk-sharing in financial markets also contributed.3 Whatever the reason for the fall in macroeconomic volatility, if investors have come to expect this past performance to continue, they might believe that less compensation for risk--and thus a lower term premium--is required to justify holding longer-term bonds. For example, some observers have pointed to factors that may create a longer-term drag on the growth in household spending, including high energy costs, the likelihood of slower growth in house prices, and a possible reversal of recent declines in saving rates.\n",

      " In my time at the Federal Reserve, I have had a number of opportunities to meet with community economic development leaders to discuss issues of mutual concern and learn about the valuable role that community development organizations play in economically distressed areas across the country. To know whether our policies and programs are delivering the desired results, we need to be able to measure inputs and outcomes, program by program and community by community. In recent years, we have seen a series of data-collection initiatives outside the public sector, with objectives that include the improvement of development strategies, the identification of new opportunities, the quantification of risk, and the exertion of influence on the direction of public policy. Still, improving the measurement of inputs and outcomes is critical to better development policy. This approach focuses on business indicators--buying power, market size, unmet needs, and market risks--rather than on the deficiency statistics typically used to describe inner-city neighborhoods, such as rates of poverty, crime, and overcrowding. Thus far, fifteen potential investors have subscribed to the CARS database, including socially responsible investment funds, brokerage houses, large financial institutions, and national foundations.4 Although still in its early stages, this initiative, if successful, will have the double benefit of attracting more funds into community development and helping to ensure that those funds are effectively used. The development of more and better data on economically distressed communities, together with sophisticated tools for analyzing those data, is essential for continued progress in community economic development.\n",

      " Anacostia struggled as public housing complexes fell into disrepair, many homes were abandoned, crime rates increased, and poverty rates climbed. In the communities which I had the opportunity to visit, the number of business establishments increased by about 7 percent between 1998 and 2003.4 In light of the public and private investments in this community, it is not surprising that some of the most rapid growth was in the number of firms in construction (64%) and in the finance and insurance industries (47%). Industry data for these communities reveal significant increases in the number of establishments in educational services, such as academic and arts schools and training centers (a 118% gain); professional, scientific, and technical services such as offices of lawyers and engineers (a 35% increase); and health care and social assistance including medical care and daycare centers (a 15% gain).5 Although the rate of homeownership in Ward 8 is still only about half the average for the city as a whole, progress has been made on that count as well. From 1990 to 2000, the homeownership rate in Ward 8 increased by 22 percent, and I have little doubt that further improvement has occurred since 2000, given the completion of 765 owner-occupied housing units since 2001 and an additional 210 under construction due to be completed by 2006.6 Beyond AnacostiaWhat does Anacostia's experience offer for other communities confronting economic decline, given the reality of limited resources and the financial risks associated with redeveloping distressed areas?\n",

      " If leveraged investors default while holding positions that are large relative to the markets in which they have invested, the forced liquidation of those positions, possibly at fire-sale prices, could cause heavy losses to counterparties. These direct losses are of concern, of course, particularly if they lead to further defaults or threaten systemically important institutions; but, in addition, market participants that were not creditors or counterparties of the defaulting firm might be affected indirectly through asset price adjustments, liquidity strains, and increased market uncertainty. Since the LTCM crisis, ongoing improvements in counterparty risk management and the resultant strengthening of market discipline appear to have limited hedge fund leverage and improved the ability of banks and broker-dealers to monitor risk, despite the rapidly increasing size, diversity, and complexity of the hedge fund industry. Many hedge funds have been liquidated, and investors have suffered losses, but creditors and counterparties have, for the most part, not taken losses. Despite this progress, some concerns about counterparty risk management remain and may have become even more pronounced given the increasing complexity of financial products. Fourth, supervisors are concerned that the assessment of counterparty risks should be better tied to the amount of transparency offered by hedge funds. Liquidity in a particular market segment might well decline sharply and unexpectedly if hedge funds chose or were forced to reduce a large exposure in that segment. A risk of any prescriptive regulatory regime is that, by creating moral hazard in the marketplace, it leaves the system less rather than more stable.\n",

      " The current system of bank capital standards, the so-called Basel I framework agreed upon internationally in 1988, was a major step forward in that it embodied the important principle that regulatory capital requirements should be tied to the risks taken by each banking institution.2 However, the relatively crude method of assigning risk weights to assets, as well as an emphasis on balance-sheet risks as opposed to other risks facing financial firms, limits the overall responsiveness of capital requirements to risk under Basel I, which renders that system increasingly inadequate for supervising the largest and most complex banking organizations. Borrowers have more choices and greater access to credit; lenders and investors are better able to measure and manage risk; and, because of the dispersion of financial risks to those more willing and able to bear them, the economy and the financial system are more resilient. Basel II is a comprehensive framework for improving bank safety and soundness by more closely linking regulatory capital requirements with bank risk, by improving the ability of supervisors and financial markets to assess capital adequacy, and by giving banking organizations stronger incentives to improve risk measurement and management. This greater sensitivity would be achieved by linking each banking organization's capital requirement to empirically based measures of credit and operational risk, as determined in part by risk parameters estimated by that organization, such as a loan's probability of default and its expected loss given default.\n",

      " For the past three years or so, economic growth in the United States has been robust, reflecting both the ongoing re-employment of underutilized resources as well as the expansion of the economy’s underlying productive potential, as determined by factors such as productivity trends and the growth of the labor force. As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve some moderation in the growth of economic activity to a rate more consistent with the expansion of the nation’s underlying productive capacity. In particular, investment in nonresidential structures, which had been weak since 2001, seems to have picked up appreciably, raising the possibility that increased nonresidential construction may absorb some of the resources released by the slowing housing sector. Along with greater national saving in the United States, increased domestic demand in countries with current account surpluses and a greater flexibility of exchange rates more broadly would help to reduce those imbalances over time. Subdued growth in most broad measures of nominal labor compensation and the ongoing expansion of labor productivity have held down the rise in unit labor costs, the largest component of business costs. In particular, the evidence of recent decades, both from the United States and other countries, supports the conclusion that an environment of price stability promotes maximum sustainable growth in employment and output and a more stable real economy. The best way to prevent increases in energy and commodity prices from leading to persistently higher rates of inflation is by anchoring the public’s long-term inflation expectations.\n",

      " One leading explanation for the strong U.S. productivity performance is that labor and product markets in the United States tend to be more flexible and competitive, and that these market characteristics have allowed the United States to realize greater economic benefits from the new technologies. Likewise, in product markets, a high degree of competition and low barriers to the entry of new firms in most industries in the United States provide strong incentives for firms to find ways to cut costs and to improve their products. Competition is one of the key benefits of free and open trade; companies that are exposed to global competition tend to be much more efficient and to produce goods of higher quality than companies that are sheltered from international competition. A recent study found that business establishments in the United Kingdom that are owned by U.S. multinationals get higher productivity from information technology than do other establishments, and it tied this differential to the management and organization of U.S. firms.3 Finally, relatively more positive attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the United States--a factor that spans economics and sociology--may also stimulate innovation and its commercial application as well as economic policies that support innovation. If you remain nimble in searching out new and unexpected opportunities, it will not only benefit you, but it will also benefit the economy and our society, as long experience has shown that dynamism and creativity are the seeds of innovation and of progress.\n",

      " These families generally have less of a cushion to absorb unanticipated expenses or to deal with adverse circumstances, such as the loss of employment or a serious health problem. For example, research that analyzed data on nearly 40,000 mortgage loans targeted to lower-income borrowers found that families that received individual financial counseling were less likely later to become delinquent on their mortgage payments.3 Similarly, another study found that borrowers who sought and received assistance from a credit counseling agency improved their credit management, in particular, by reducing the number of credit accounts on which they carried positive balances, cutting overall debt, and reducing delinquency rates.4 More broadly, the research shows that financial knowledge is correlated with good financial outcomes; for example, individuals familiar with basic financial concepts and products have been found to be more likely to balance their checkbook every month, budget for savings, and hold investment accounts.5 Studies that establish an association between financial knowledge and good financial outcomes are encouraging, but they do not necessarily prove that financial training and counseling are the causes of the better outcomes. It could be, for example, that counseling is associated with better financial outcomes because the consumers who choose to seek counseling are the ones who are already better informed or more motivated to make good financial decisions.

Supervisors have encouraged the continuous improvement of banks' systems for managing market risk by emphasizing that bankers bear responsibility for understanding and managing their risk profiles and by issuing guidance that, in some cases, includes industry advances in risk management. Both robust risk management and strong capital positions are critical to ensure that individual banking organizations operate in a safe and sound manner that enhances the stability of the financial system. For example, under Basel I, a bank's regulatory capital requirement takes no account of the specific risk profile of its commercial loan portfolio, deterioration in asset quality, the risks of certain off-balance-sheet transactions or fee-based activities, and actions banks may take to mitigate balance sheet risks. This greater sensitivity would be achieved by linking each banking organization's capital requirement to empirically based measures of credit and operational risk; these measures would be determined in part by risk parameters estimated by the banks, such as a loan's probability of default and its expected loss given default.\n",

      " For the most part, high oil prices reflect high and growing demand for oil and limited and uncertain supplies. In all likelihood, growth in the demand for energy will be tempered to some extent by continued improvements in energy efficiency which, in turn, will be stimulated by higher prices and ongoing concerns about the security of oil supplies. Both U.S. and Canadian gas fields have matured and are yielding smaller increases in output, despite the incentive of high prices and a substantial increase in the number of drilling rigs in operation. For the medium term at least, the higher bill for oil imports will increase the U.S. current account deficit, implying a greater need for foreign financing. Moreover, ongoing productivity gains arising from sources such as technological improvements are likely to exceed by a significant margin the productivity losses created by high energy prices. In addition, higher energy costs may have indirect effects on the inflation rate--if, for example, firms pass on their increased costs of production in the form of higher consumer prices for non-energy goods or services or if workers respond to the increase in the cost of living by demanding higher nominal wages. The Federal Reserve attempted to contain the inflationary effects of the oil-price shocks by engineering sharp increases in interest rates, actions which had the consequence of sharply slowing growth and raising unemployment, as in the recessions that began in 1973 and 1981.\n",

      "  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to come back to Dillon and very grateful for the honor you have done me today. The original store was on Main Street, but when the chain stores entered the local market, my dad and uncle built a new, larger, and more modern store a block off Main. They competed by offering personal, first-name service, by delivering prescriptions without charge, and by coming down to the store at any time, nights or Sundays, to fill an emergency prescription. I saw the long hours and persistent effort my parents put in to make their independent small business successful. The second thing I learned in Dillon is that Americans are economically ambitious; they seek opportunity and advancement. I was impressed by these experiences, and I think they were an important reason I went into economics, which a great economist once called the study of people in the ordinary business of life. However, I try not to forget what underlies all those data: millions of Americans working hard, trying to better themselves economically, struggling to manage their family finances, and worrying about the price of gas and college tuition. I take my work extremely seriously because I know that, if my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I do our jobs right, we will help our economy prosper and give more people the economic opportunities they seek.\n",

      " These advances were achieved despite adverse developments that included the 2001 recession, the terrorist attacks of September 11, corporate governance scandals, and in the past few years, devastating hurricanes and very substantial increases in the cost of energy. Second, as I have noted, productivity growth increased very rapidly earlier this decade and has continued to rise at a solid pace, even though IT investment declined sharply after the stock prices of high-tech firms plummeted in 2000. Likewise, in product markets, a high degree of competition and low barriers to the entry of new firms in most industries in the United States provide strong incentives for firms to find ways to cut costs and to improve their products. Also, although it is not a feature unique to the United States, the increasing degree of openness of our economy to trade and foreign investment and the consequent exposure of U.S. companies to the rigors of international as well as domestic competition, may have promoted productivity growth.2 As a leading example, productivity gains in U.S. manufacturing--which is particularly subject to international competition--have been especially impressive in recent years, averaging, by one measure, about 6 percent per year over the past decade.3 A number of other explanations have been advanced for the relatively stronger performance of productivity in the United States in recent years, including international differences in management practices, the depth and sophistication of U.S. capital markets, more favorable attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the United States, and the role of U.S. research universities in fostering innovation.4 Further study of national productivity differentials clearly is warranted.\n",

      " Inherent in that choice are questions of intergenerational equity and economic efficiency, questions that are difficult to answer definitively but are nevertheless among the most critical that we face as a nation. In that case, the taxes collected by the federal government would have to rise from about 18 percent of GDP today to about 24 percent of GDP in 2030, an increase of one-third in the tax burden over the next twenty-five years, with more increases to follow. Besides tax increases, spending cuts, or reform of the major entitlement programs, the fourth possible fiscal response to population aging is to accommodate a portion of rising entitlement obligations through increases in the federal budget deficit. This case obviously involves greater sacrifice by the current generation, but the payoff is that all future generations enjoy per capita consumption that is only 4 percent, rather than 14 percent, below what it would have been in the absence of population aging. On the other hand, I suspect that many people would agree that a fair outcome should involve the current generation shouldering at least some of that burden, especially in light of the sacrifices that previous generations made to give us the prosperity we enjoy today. And slower growth in the labor force will motivate employers to retain or attract older workers--for example through higher wages, more flexibility in work schedules, increased training directed toward older workers, and changes in the retirement incentives provided by pension plans.\n",

      " The Bank Secrecy ActThe prevention and detection of the criminal misuse of the financial system, including threats to national security such as the financing of terrorist activities, are among the highest of public policy priorities. The primary goal of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), passed by the Congress in 1970, is to help deter, detect, and investigate money laundering and other financial crimes, including terrorist financing. The potential benefits of the information obtained through the BSA are large, but implementation of the act should not ignore other public policy considerations, including the need to maintain a reasonable expectation of financial privacy for legitimate bank customers and to ensure that reporting requirements do not unduly impede the efficient operation of the payments system. Deterring and identifying misuse of the financial system, as important as that is, should not be so onerous that it stifles innovation, interferes with the critical economic functions of financial intermediaries, places undue burden on bank shareholders and customers, or reduces the international competitiveness of U.S. banks. First, the industry should have the opportunity to receive feedback about the usefulness of reporting suspicious activity as well as guidance about how better to identify the most significant risks. Efforts to further increase feedback would help banks allocate their compliance resources more efficiently while complying with the act and preventing misuse of the financial system. This concern can be seen, for example, in the proposal's transitional safeguards, which go beyond those in the 2004 Basel Committee text by providing greater protection against unintended declines in minimum capital requirements during the initial years of Basel II implementation.\n",

      " As the pricing of credit risk has become more sophisticated and more consistent, as scale economies have reduced costs, and as funding sources have increased, lenders have been able to extend credit to households and businesses that might previously have been considered uncreditworthy. From 1995 to 2004, the share of households with mortgage debt increased 17 percent, and in the lowest income quintile, the share of households with mortgage debt rose 53 percent.2 Although the emergence of risk-based pricing has increased access to credit for all households, it has also raised some concerns and questions, which are magnified in the case of lower-income borrowers. Between 1997 and 2002, the number of businesses owned by Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and women grew more than 20 percent for each group--more than twice the national rate of increase for all businesses.9 Nevertheless, small businesses face continual challenges. According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Small Business Finances, for example, the proportions of businesses that were either denied credit or did not apply for fear of being turned down were similar across neighborhood income groups.11 CDFIs as a Solution to Market FailuresMany factors have contributed to the economic gains that I have cited, including broad macroeconomic forces and advances in the delivery of financial services. For example, on average, lower-income areas have fewer owner-occupied homes and record fewer home-purchase loans than higher-income areas do.14 Lower transaction activity makes accurately gauging property values and evaluating credit risks in those areas more difficult, which may inhibit the extension of credit.15 Alternatively, lower-income people may have shorter and more-irregular credit histories, making an evaluation of their individual creditworthiness more difficult and costly.\n",

      " Why have monetary aggregates not been more influential in U.S. monetary policymaking, despite the strong theoretical presumption that money growth should be linked to growth in nominal aggregates and to inflation? Similar problems arose in the early 1980s--the period of the Volcker experiment--when the introduction of new types of bank accounts again made M1 money demand difficult to predict.12 Attempts to find stable relationships between M1 growth and growth in other nominal quantities were unsuccessful, and formal growth rate targets for M1 were discontinued in 1987. Unfortunately, forecast errors for money growth are often significant, and the empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable at times.18 Despite these difficulties, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor and analyze the behavior of money. The achievement, for example, of the objective of a price level varying inversely with the productive efficiency of society demands a highly energetic central banking policy and a high degree of effectiveness of monetary control… Even for the achievement of the more modest objective of lessening business fluctuations by monetary means, the degree of control of the central bank is of paramount importance.\" Another object of criticism was \"base drift,\" a set of practices that had the effect of re-setting the base from which money growth targets were calculated when the growth of one or more monetary aggregates exceeded the upper end of the Federal Reserve’s target range.\n",

      " The global economy continues to be strong, with cyclical recoveries under way in Europe and Japan and ongoing growth in the emerging-market economies; this growth abroad should support the continuing expansion of U.S. exports of goods and services. The motor vehicle sector may already be showing signs of strengthening; after having cut production significantly in recent months in response to the rise in the inventory of unsold vehicles, automakers appear to have boosted the assembly rate a bit in November, and they have scheduled further increases for December. Even if productivity growth is sustained at a reasonably good rate, the slower expansion of the labor force will imply some moderation in the rate of growth of potential output over the next few years. The sharp increases in energy and materials costs figured in the rise in core inflation as well, as some suppliers of non-energy goods and services may have been able to pass through their higher input costs into final prices.More-rapid increases in shelter costs also boosted core consumer inflation over the past year. The most recent monthly increases in OER generally have been smaller than those earlier in the year, and further slowing may occur as the supply of rental units increases and the demand for owner-occupied housing stabilizes.

      " However, from 1990 to 2005, productivity grew at an even more impressive rate of 9 percent per year.4 Many factors have contributed to this strong productivity performance, including high rates of capital investment, increasing openness to trade, and a strengthening of the educational system.5 However, in my view, the single most important cause of the ongoing expansion in productivity is that China has moved, gradually but steadily, away from central planning and toward a greater reliance on markets. Although the expansion of the market-based portion of the economy has yielded impressive results, further gains could be achieved by allowing still greater scope for market forces. Greater use of market pricing in the energy sector, including the elimination of remaining price controls on fuels and the liberalization of electricity prices, would support cleaner, sustainable economic growth by promoting more-efficient use of energy by households and firms and by encouraging the development of new energy supplies.9 Significant benefits could also be obtained by allowing a larger role for market forces in guiding investment decisions. An example is the steel industry, in which excess capacity appears to have tripled between 2002 and 2005 to reach more than 115 million metric tons.11 Allowing competitive financial markets to play a larger role in the allocation of capital would likely increase the returns to investment and reduce the risk that uneconomic investments could exacerbate the problem of nonperforming loans and contribute to future financial instability.\n",

The forum is one outgrowth of the increased interaction between central banks and academic institutions that, in my opinion, benefits both groups. It is a true joint effort involving the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve Board, the BMW Institute for German and European Studies at Georgetown University, and the Centre for Financial Studies at Goethe University in Frankfurt. You have a very full agenda for the next two days. The topics represent a good mix of theoretical work as well as empirical work based on both calibration and econometric estimation. You are beginning with two papers that emphasize the importance of inflation expectations. Other papers examine such topics as the application of search theory, the functioning of mortgage markets, the theoretical analysis of optimal monetary policy, and empirical research on price-setting.\n",

      " When a financial institution is under considerable stress, however, it is helpful to have available in-house supervisors who can independently assess the borrowing institution and evaluate its collateral.5 Bank supervision and the prevention and management of financial crisesAlthough the Federal Reserve is today best known to the public as the agency responsible for monetary policy, the Fed was founded in 1913 largely in response to the periodic episodes of banking panics and other forms of financial instability that had plagued the U.S. economy during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963).6 Today, the Fed retains its key role in the prevention and mitigation of financial crises, for a number of reasons. As a result of the cooperative efforts of market participants and regulators, these backlogs have been cut sharply, reducing the risk that incomplete trading records could complicate the evaluation of firms’ positions and financial conditions in a crisis. When financial problems do develop, however, the Fed and other policymakers face the important threshold question of whether public action is warranted; in particular, they must weigh the expected benefits of taking action against the possibility that such action will encourage excessive private risk-taking in the future (the moral hazard problem). To minimize the moral hazard problem, policymakers should act only in those cases in which it seems likely that inaction would risk systemic problems with the potential to damage the broader economy; and if they act, they should do so in ways that disturb market outcomes as little as possible.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Another difficult question is how to balance the need for maintaining strong market-based incentives, which support economic growth and efficiency but may be associated with greater inequality of results, against the goal of insuring individuals against the most adverse outcomes, which may reduce inequality but also tends to diminish the strength of incentives. At least until recently, most such activity appears to have involved goods and services that use relatively more low-skilled labor, which (all else being equal) would tend through the workings of supply and demand to slow the growth of wages of domestic low-skilled workers relative to those with greater skills (Feenstra and Hanson, 1996).9 Unfortunately, much of the available empirical research on the influence of trade on earnings inequality dates from the 1980s and 1990s and thus does not address later developments. To be sure, the advent of new technologies and increased international trade can lead to painful dislocations as some workers lose their jobs or see the demand for their particular skills decline.10  But hindering the adoption of new technologies or inhibiting trade flows would do far more harm than good, as technology and trade are critical sources of overall economic growth and of increases in the standard of living. Recent research--some sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in collaboration with the University of Minnesota--has documented the high returns that early childhood programs can pay in terms of subsequent educational attainment and in lower rates of social problems, such as teenage pregnancy and welfare dependency.11  The most successful early childhood programs appear to be those that cultivate both cognitive and noncognitive skills and that engage families in stimulating learning at home (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006).\n",

      " A narrower question, but one that is critical for monetary policy makers, is whether the increased openness of the U.S. economy has in some way affected the ability of the Federal Reserve to meet its congressional mandate to foster price stability and maximum sustainable employment. First, the expansion of trade may cause domestic inflation to depend to a greater extent on the prices of imported goods--not only because imported goods enter the consumer basket or (in the case of imported intermediate goods) affect the costs of domestic production, but because competition with imports affects the pricing power of domestic producers. However, the rise in profit rates in recent years seems inconsistent with the view that markups have declined (Bowman, 2003; Kohn, 2006).9 The competition fostered by trade should also promote productivity growth, reducing growth in costs and making the attainment of low inflation easier. In other words, all else being equal, would a booming world economy increase the potential for inflationary pressures within the United States?In principle, with the domestic determinants of inflation held constant, reduced slack in the global economy could increase domestic inflation for a time if it led to higher prices for some traded goods and services relative to the prices of goods and services that are not usually traded. However, the rise in profit rates in recent years seems inconsistent with the view that markups have declined (Bowman, 2003; Kohn, 2006).9 The competition fostered by trade should also promote productivity growth, reducing growth in costs and making the attainment of low inflation easier.\n",

      " A second element of the controversy surrounding the GSE portfolios arises from the fact that they are not only large but also potentially subject to significant volatility and financial risk (including credit risk, interest-rate risk, and prepayment risk) and operational risk. As I have also noted, their low cost of borrowing gives GSEs an advantage over market participants in profitably financing the acquisition of just about any market-priced asset (other than U.S. Treasuries), and it creates a strong incentive for these companies to look for new types of assets to acquire and to find new lines of business to enter.8  These ingredients--the large presence of the GSEs in financial markets, the lack of market discipline exercised by investors in GSE senior debt, and the incentives for continued portfolio growth--led the Federal Reserve Board to conclude that while the GSEs do not seem to pose an immediate risk of financial difficulty, their portfolios continue to represent a potentially significant source of systemic risk. The largest banks are more diversified than the GSEs; and although banks likely assume greater credit risks, they probably are less subject to interest-rate risk than are GSEs.11  Moreover, the recent experience of the GSEs suggests that they are subject to at least as much operational risk as the large banks. Regardless, little social benefit is gained by encouraging the concentration of the substantial interest rate risks associated with long-term mortgages into only two government-sponsored organizations, when such risk could be easily distributed across tens of thousands of entities, both domestic and foreign, through the process of mortgage securitization.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Besides discrimination a variety of economic and institutional factors help to explain the relative unavailability of credit in lower-income neighborhoods.2 Thirty years ago, the secondary market for mortgages was rudimentary at best, which limited local loan originators' access to capital and reduced their ability to diversify credit risks geographically.3 Informational problems also inhibited lending in some urban areas. Similarly, credit evaluations tend to be more costly for lower-income borrowers, who are relatively more likely to have short or irregular credit histories.5 Informational barriers to lending were heightened by the absence of uniform national depositories of information on the credit experiences of consumers; at the time, the credit-reporting system consisted of hundreds of local credit bureaus, each of which maintained limited information on local residents.6 The high costs of gathering information, together with the difficulty of keeping information proprietary, may have created a \"first-mover\" problem, in which each financial institution has an incentive to let one of its competitors be the first to enter an underserved market. A paper by Board staff members compared census tracts just above and below the low- and moderate-income threshold, finding that the tracts below the threshold had higher homeownership rates, higher growth in owner-occupied units, and lower vacancy rates than would have otherwise been predicted (Avery, Calem, and Canner, 2003). However, recent problems in mortgage markets illustrate that an underlying assumption of the CRA--that more lending equals better outcomes for local communities may not always hold.12 Whether, and if so, how to try to differentiate \"good\" from \"bad\" lending in the CRA context is an issue that is likely to challenge us for some time.\n",

      " I am pleased to be able to be here today, at the Greater Washington Jump$tart Coalition's inaugural event, to celebrate Financial Literacy Month 2007 and to say a few words about the importance of financial education. As you think about the time, not so far away now, when you will leave Wilson High, I hope that you will resolve to keep, throughout your life, the habits of learning and of thinking for yourself that you have gained in your years here. Because credit has become such an integral part of our economy, and because there are so many sources and forms of credit available, much more financial sophistication is required today than when I attended high school. As a parent of two young adults myself, I believe that helping young people become financially literate is critical for their future economic well-being and should be a high priority for educators. The Coalition is a national leader among organizations that work to improve the personal financial literacy of students from kindergarten to the university level. In particular, through its biennial survey of high school seniors, Jump$tart has brought increased attention to the issue of financial literacy among youth in the United States. This new chapter of Jump$tart has joined forces with over fifty individuals, businesses, and not-for-profit, educational, and government organizations, including the Federal Reserve Board, to increase knowledge about personal finance among schoolchildren and young adults in the Greater Washington, D.C., region. There is no higher nor more worthy objective than preparing our young people for fulfilling and productive lives.\n",

      " Today, in a world of container ships, jumbo jets, and the Internet, goods and many services are delivered faster and more cheaply (in inflation-adjusted terms) than ever before.1 Today I will discuss the crucial economic benefits we receive from the ongoing expansion of international trade. The Benefits of TradeAt the most basic level, trade is beneficial because it allows people to specialize in the goods and services they produce best and most efficiently. Another substantial benefit of trade is the effect it tends to have on the productivity of domestic firms and on the quality of their output.4 By creating a global market, trade enhances competition, which weeds out the most inefficient firms and induces others to improve their products and to produce more efficiently. This country provides many high-value services to users abroad, including financial, legal, engineering, architectural, and software development services, whereas many of the services imported by U.S. companies are less sophisticated and hence of lower value.9 A recent study of twenty-one occupations that are most likely to be affected by outsourcing found that net job losses were concentrated almost exclusively in the lower-wage occupations and that strong employment gains have occurred in the occupations that pay the highest wages.10 Further expansion of trade in services will help, not hurt, the U.S. economy and the labor market. The better approach to mitigating the disruptive effects of trade is to adopt policies and programs aimed at easing the transition of displaced workers into new jobs and increasing the adaptability and skills of the labor force more generally.\n",

      " In addressing the challenges and the risks that financial innovation may create, we should also always keep in view the enormous economic benefits that flow from a healthy and innovative financial sector. Indeed, the need for better risk sharing and risk management has been a primary driving force behind the recent wave of innovation. Complexity--especially when combined with illiquidity--amplifies the difficulty of measuring risk, both market risk and counterparty credit risk. If hedge funds and the large banks that are hedge funds' counterparties and creditors have difficulty assessing the risks associated with complex financial instruments, many investors will find gaining a sufficient understanding of the risks even more burdensome. Importantly, best practices must address the challenges I mentioned earlier, including those relating to the complexity of instruments and strategies (which can make exposures difficult to measure), the illiquidity or potential illiquidity of positions held by the firm or its counterparties, and the risks of embedded as well as explicit leverage. Risk-focused regulators and supervisors in turn should encourage effective implementation of these best practices, particularly in situations in which the potential for misuse, either intentional or unintentional, is high. Although financial innovation promotes those objectives in some ways, for example by allowing better sharing of risks, certain aspects of financial innovation--including the complexity of financial instruments and trading strategies, the illiquidity or potential illiquidity of certain instruments, and explicit or embedded leverage--may pose significant risks.\n",

      " However, the Federal Reserve failed to avert the banking panics of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the longest and most severe series of banking panics in U.S. history. The tendency of banks to take on excessive risks when they face little economic penalty for doing so is an example of what economists call a moral hazard problem. Market discipline may erode further if market participants believe that, to avoid the risk of a financial crisis, the government will step in to prevent the failure of any very large institution--the “too big to fail” problem. Receivership rules that make clear that investors will take losses when a bank becomes insolvent should increase the perceived risk of loss and thus also increase market discipline. For example, the requirement for prompt corrective action prohibits regulatory forbearance when a bank’s capital falls to a predetermined level; and the least-cost-resolution requirement compels regulators to resolve a troubled bank at the lowest cost to the deposit insurance fund.2 Improving and broadening the requirements for disclosing information are yet another method of strengthening the invisible hand. In addition, market participants that were not creditors or counterparties of the defaulting firm might be harmed indirectly through changes in asset prices, liquidity strains, and increased market uncertainty. However, doing so would have been costly and technically difficult, would have increased moral hazard by relieving investors and counterparties of the responsibility for monitoring the funds, and likely would have reduced the social benefits of hedge funds by hampering the ability of their managers to respond quickly and flexibly to changing market conditions.\n",

      " Subprime mortgages are loans made to borrowers who are perceived to have high credit risk, often because they lack a strong credit history or have other characteristics that are associated with high probabilities of default. Having emerged more than two decades ago, subprime mortgage lending began to expand in earnest in the mid-1990s, the expansion spurred in large part by innovations that reduced the costs for lenders of assessing and pricing risks. The growth of the secondary market has thus given mortgage lenders greater access to the capital markets, lowered transaction costs, and spread risk more broadly, thereby increasing the supply of mortgage credit to all types of households. For these mortgages, the rate of serious delinquencies--corresponding to mortgages in foreclosure or with payments ninety days or more overdue--rose sharply during 2006 and recently stood at about 11 percent, about double the recent low seen in mid-2005.3   The rate of serious delinquencies has also risen somewhat among some types of near-prime mortgages, although the rate in that category remains much lower than the rate in the subprime market. Regional economic problems have played a role as well; for example, some of the states with the highest delinquency and foreclosure rates are among those most hard-hit by job cuts in the auto industry. With effective loan restructuring, borrowers facing temporary economic setbacks may be able to work through their problems while staying in their homes, and lenders may be able to avoid the costs of foreclosure and the losses usually associated with selling a repossessed home.\n",

      "  As a former member of the Princeton community, I am very pleased to see the university recognizing these young people--the two prize winners, John Gentile and Brianna Casey Lyons, as well as the eight certificate recipients--for demonstrating exemplary leadership in the area of race relations. As you have heard, John energetically advocated improved race relations in his own school and helped to bring diversity concerns before a wider group of high schools in the District of Columbia metro area. Robinson was a great baseball player, but--critically, for the mission he set out to accomplish--he was also a great leader, a person of courage and character. Both men played the game superbly, but whereas Jackie Robinson was honored and recognized in his lifetime for his achievements, both as a baseball player and a civil rights leader, recognition of Josh Gibson came only after his death. It is tragic that Gibson did not live to see the integration of major league baseball or to enjoy the honors that were due him. However, even though society's recognition of Gibson's achievements came too late for him to enjoy it, honoring him was still worthwhile. The belated recognition of Gibson illustrates a most important reason to honor achievement: We do it not so much for the person being honored but rather for ourselves. And, usually, the aspect of an achievement that is most worth recognizing is not the achievement itself but the spirit of energy, determination, and courage that made it possible.\n",

      " Despite recent increases in the prices of crude oil and gasoline, energy prices overall are below last year’s peak; the rate of increase in shelter costs seems likely to slow, although the timing remains uncertain; and long-run inflation expectations, as derived from both surveys and market-based measures of inflation compensation, have remained contained. Despite the drop in homebuilding, the inventory of unsold new homes has risen to more than seven months of sales, a level well above the average observed over the past decade. But decelerating house prices, higher interest rates, and slower economic growth have contributed to an increased rate of delinquency among subprime borrowers. Some of the increased difficulties now being experienced by subprime borrowers are likely the result of an earlier loosening of underwriting standards, as evidenced by the pronounced rise in 2006 in “early payment defaults”--defaults occurring within a few months of mortgage origination. All told, the rate of serious delinquencies for subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates--corresponding to mortgages in the foreclosure process or with payments ninety or more days overdue--has risen to about 12 percent, roughly double the recent low seen in mid-2005.1  The rate of serious delinquencies has also risen somewhat among some types of near-prime mortgages, although the delinquency rates in those categories remain much lower than the rate in the subprime market. However, fundamental factors--including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates--should ultimately support the demand for housing, and at this point, the troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system.\n",

      " In the United States, a deep and liquid financial system has promoted growth by effectively allocating capital and has increased economic resilience by increasing our ability to share and diversify risks both domestically and globally. A weak banking system grappling with nonperforming loans and insufficient capital or firms whose creditworthiness has eroded because of high leverage or declining asset values are examples of financial conditions that could undermine growth. Japan faced just this kind of challenge when the financial problems of banks and corporations contributed substantially to sub-par growth during the so-called \"lost decade.\" The widespread banking panics of the 1930s caused many banks to shut their doors; facing the risk of runs by depositors, even those who remained open were forced to constrain lending to keep their balance sheets as liquid as possible. However, in the 1930s, declining output and falling prices (which increased real debt burdens) led to widespread financial distress among borrowers, lessening their capacity to pledge collateral or to otherwise retain significant equity interests in their proposed investments. Fundamentally, a financially strong borrower has more \"skin in the game,\" so to speak, and consequently has greater incentives to make well-informed investment choices and to take the actions needed to ensure good financial outcomes. In the hypothetical case that Gertler and I analyzed, an increase in productivity that improves the cash flows and balance sheet positions of firms leads in turn to lower external finance premiums in subsequent periods, which extends the expansion as firms are induced to continue investing even after the initial productivity shock has dissipated.\n",

      " More fundamentally, experience suggests that high and persistent inflation undermines public confidence in the economy and in the management of economic policy generally, with potentially adverse effects on risk-taking, investment, and other productive activities that are sensitive to the public's assessments of the prospects for future economic stability. In the long term, low inflation promotes growth, efficiency, and stability--which, all else being equal, support maximum sustainable employment, the other leg of the mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.Admittedly, measuring the long-term relationship between growth or productivity and inflation is difficult. For example, if the central bank and the public learn from experience that high inflation imposes greater costs and fewer benefits than previously thought, then the equilibrium will adjust toward one with lower inflation and lower inflation expectations. Cogley and Sargent (2007) explore the Stock-Watson specification in more detail, arguing that the transitory component of inflation is best modeled as having somewhat greater persistence. More fundamentally, experience suggests that high and persistent inflation undermines public confidence in the economy and in the management of economic policy generally, with potentially adverse effects on risk-taking, investment, and other productive activities that are sensitive to the public's assessments of the prospects for future economic stability.

      " The problems have been most severe for subprime mortgages with adjustable rates:  the proportion of those loans with serious delinquencies rose to about 13-1/2 percent in June, more than double the recent low seen in mid-2005.1  The adjustable-rate subprime mortgages originated in late 2005 and in 2006 have performed the worst, in part because of slippage in underwriting standards, reflected for example in high loan-to-value ratios and incomplete documentation. Also, as in many episodes of financial stress, uncertainty about possible forced sales by leveraged participants and a higher cost of risk capital seem to have made investors hesitant to take advantage of possible buying opportunities. In the statement following its August 7 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recognized that the rise in financial volatility and the tightening of credit conditions for some households and businesses had increased the downside risks to growth somewhat but reiterated that inflation risks remained its predominant policy concern. In particular, the further tightening of credit conditions, if sustained, would increase the risk that the current weakness in housing could be deeper or more prolonged than previously expected, with possible adverse effects on consumer spending and the economy more generally. In all but one recession during the period from 1960 to 1999, declines in residential investment accounted for at least 40 percent of the decline in overall real GDP, and the sole exception--the 1970 recession--was preceded by a substantial decline in housing activity before the official start of the downturn.\n",

      " The proximate cause of the increase in the U.S. external deficit was a decline in U.S. saving; between 1996 and 2004, the investment rate in the United States remained almost unchanged at about 19 percent of GDP, whereas the saving rate declined from 16-1/2 percent to slightly less than 14 percent of GDP.2  Domestic investment not funded by domestic saving must be financed by capital flows from abroad, and, indeed, the large increase in the U.S. current account deficit was matched by a similar expansion of net capital inflows. Second, sharp increases in crude oil prices boosted oil exporters' incomes by more than those countries were able or willing to increase spending, thereby leading to higher saving and current account surpluses. Finally, Chinese saving rates rose rapidly (by more even than investment rates); that rise in saving was, perhaps, a result of the strong growth in incomes in the midst of an underdeveloped financial sector and a weak social safety net that increases the motivation for precautionary saving. Also, the further expansion of the region's net supply of saving in the past two years appears to reflect primarily an increase in desired saving by the emerging-market countries, whereas the previous increase in net saving also involved some decline in desired investment in East Asia after the financial crises of the 1990s. Second, current account imbalances can help reduce tendencies toward recession, on the one hand, or overheating and inflation, on the other.11  During the late 1990s, for example, the developing Asian economies that had experienced financial crises and consequent collapses in domestic investment benefited from being able to run trade surpluses, which helped strengthen aggregate demand and employment.\n",

      " Although the United States has long been a world leader in expanding educational opportunities, we have also long grappled with challenges, such as troubling high-school dropout rates, particularly for minority and immigrant youths, and frustratingly slow and uneven progress in raising test scores and other measures of educational achievement. That means, of course, that we will have to grapple with difficult issues--how to boost educational attainment, particularly for minorities and immigrant youths; how to make more consistent and noticeable progress in raising academic achievement; and how to ensure that older workers have meaningful opportunities to refresh their skills. The proportion of those from low-income families who enroll in college the following fall has been moving up gradually, but it remains much lower--just over 50 percent.6   This discrepancy holds even for students classified as high achievers:  A longitudinal study of eighth graders in 1988 found that only 29 percent of those scoring in the top fourth of the group in math--but who were from families with low social and economic status--had completed a bachelor’s degree or more by 2000, while three-fourths of those from families with high social and economic status finished their undergraduate degrees (Fox, Connelly, and Snyder, 2005).7   Surely, high tuition must be one barrier to attending and completing college (Card, 2001; Kane, 1994), but it is not the only barrier (Dynarski, 2005).\n",

      " That influence has been manifest in undergraduate lecture halls and graduate seminar rooms, in the best research journals, and in the highest ranks of government. I suspect that the circumstances of the mid-1970s intensified John's motivation to help improve economic performance through sound policymaking. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, John published a number of highly influential papers, including: \"Conditions for Unique Solutions in Stochastic Macroeconomic Models with Rational Expectations,\" \"Estimation and Control of a Macroeconomic Model with Rational Expectations,\" \"Aggregate Dynamics and Staggered Contracts,\" and \"Solution and Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Dynamic Nonlinear Rational Expectations Models.\" However, John's analysis showed that, in the presence of aggregate supply shocks, attempts by monetary policymakers to reduce the volatility of inflation over time could be associated with higher volatility in unemployment, and vice versa. Interestingly, John's work anticipated the possibility that improvements in the conduct of monetary policy or changes in the structure of the economy could result in a shift of the Taylor curve--that is, a change in the ability of policy to smooth both inflation and employment. The Taylor principle provides essential guidance for central banks on how to anchor long-run inflation expectations and foster stable growth and low inflation. Our economy faced severe challenges during that period--the terrorist attacks of September 11, a recession and the threat of deflation, corporate governance scandals, and economic issues posed by the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " From the traditional Keynesian perspective, which was the dominant viewpoint of the time, monetary policy faced a long-term tradeoff between inflation and unemployment that it could exploit to keep unemployment low over an indefinitely long period at an acceptable cost in terms of inflation. Nevertheless, they recognized that the fundamental economic uncertainties faced by policymakers are a first-order problem and that improving the conduct of policy would require facing that problem head on. In particular, using the interest rate as the policy instrument is the better choice when aggregate demand is relatively stable but money demand is unstable, with money growth being the preferable policy instrument in the opposite case. Because his econometric analysis of the available data indicated that money demand was more stable than aggregate demand, Bill formulated a simple rule that adjusted the money growth rate in response to the observed unemployment rate. In contrast, Robert Lucas and others reached more dramatic conclusions, arguing that only unpredictable movements in monetary policy can affect the real economy and concluding that policy has no capacity to smooth the business cycle (Lucas, 1972; Sargent and Wallace, 1975). Indeed, our appreciation of that challenge has been enhanced by recent research using real time data sets.1  For example, Athanasios Orphanides has shown that making such real-time assessments of the sustainable levels of economic activity and employment is considerably more difficult than estimating those levels retrospectively. Furthermore, when the public is unsure about the central bank's objectives, even greater benefits may accompany achieving a stable inflation rate, as doing so may help anchor the public's inflation expectations.\n",

      " I will also have little to say this evening about the serious implications of rising rates of mortgage delinquency and foreclosure for troubled borrowers and their communities or about the Federal Reserve's responses to these important problems; I have discussed these issues several times in the past and will return to them in the future. The rate of serious delinquencies has risen notably for subprime mortgages with adjustable rates, reaching nearly 16 percent in August, roughly triple the recent low in mid-2005.1  Subprime mortgages originated in late 2005 and 2006 have performed especially poorly, in part because of a deterioration in underwriting standards. Consequently, in highly stressed financial conditions, when the marketwide demand for liquidity rises sharply, one of two things must happen:  Either the central bank provides the liquidity demanded by lending against good collateral, or forced sales of illiquid assets will drive the prices of those assets well below their longer-term fundamental values, raising the risk of widespread insolvency and intensifying the crisis. As most of the meeting participants saw growth likely to run below trend for a while and with the incoming inflation data on the favorable side, the risks to inflation from this action seemed acceptable, especially as the Committee was prepared to reverse the policy easing if inflation pressures proved stronger than expected. From the perspective of the near-term economic outlook, the improved functioning of financial markets is a positive development in that it increases the likelihood of achieving moderate growth with price stability.\n",

      " The great majority of those who have benefited from Grameen Bank loans have been women, particularly poor rural women. I am very pleased to speak at your summit meeting today for many reasons, not the least of which is the opportunity to visit again with Janie Barrera, the president of Acción Texas. To a greater extent than overseas, microfinance programs here have expanded their offerings to deliver education, training, and various other services to nascent entrepreneurs. In helping local enterprises get under way, microfinance organizations help deliver the social benefits often associated with such businesses. For example, microentrepreneurs often involve their family members in their businesses, providing them valuable work experience; and extra income can confer important advantages on future generations, such as a chance for a better education. These difficulties arise because lending to small businesses is typically considered riskier and more costly than lending to larger firms. Small businesses are often more susceptible to changes in the broader economy and generally have a much higher rate of failure than larger operations, although the survival rate of small firms increases with age (Knaup, 2005).Collateral may be used to help mitigate the risk to lenders, but the smallest and youngest firms often have few assets available to pledge. Although some businesses will inevitably fall by the wayside, those that flourish and grow are likely to have better management and better long-term prospects than they would have without the support of microenterprise programs.\n",

      " Other notable milestones in the Federal Reserve's progress toward greater openness include:  in 1979, the first release of semiannual economic projections; in 1983, the first publication of the Beige Book, which summarizes information about economic conditions received from the Federal Reserve System's business contacts; in 1994, the decision to release a postmeeting statement when policy actions had been taken; in 2000, the beginning of the practice of issuing a statement after each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and including in the statement an assessment of the balance of risks to the Committee's objectives; in 2002, adding the FOMC roll call vote to the postmeeting statement; and in 2005, the speeding up of the release of the minutes of FOMC meetings, from a delay of some six or seven weeks to just three weeks. Rather, the optimal expected time required for completing the disinflation would depend on a host of factors, including the size of the initial deviation from price stability, the initial state of the real economy (for example, the level of unemployment), whether the rise in inflation resulted from transitory or more persistent sources, the extent to which inflation expectations are well anchored, and so on. But under the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, the determination of the appropriate long-run inflation rate must take account of factors that may affect the efficient functioning of the economy at very low rates of inflation, such as the risk that the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates might hinder the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n",

      " Economic growth in the period leading up to the October meeting had proven quite strong, as confirmed by this morning’s figures on third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP). Inflation was seen as edging down next year, approaching rates consistent with price stability; however, the Committee remained concerned about the possible effects of higher energy costs and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar, especially the risk that they might lead to an increase in the public’s long-term inflation expectations. I expect household income and spending to continue to grow, but the combination of higher gas prices, the weak housing market, tighter credit conditions, and declines in stock prices seem likely to create some headwinds for the consumer in the months ahead. The fresh wave of investor concern has contributed in recent weeks to a decline in equity values, a widening of risk spreads for many credit products (not only those related to housing), and increased short-term funding pressures. Economic forecasting is always difficult, but the current stresses in financial markets make the uncertainty surrounding the outlook even greater than usual. We at the Federal Reserve will have to remain exceptionally alert and flexible as we continue to assess how best to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability in the United States. The Transformation of the Economy in the CarolinasEconomically speaking, Carolinians have faced the same challenge confronting many other parts of the country, that is, to replace jobs lost in old-line manufacturing industries by creating jobs in services such as health care and hospitality while simultaneously adapting to globalization and advancing technology.\n",

      " But perhaps an even greater challenge was posed by a sharp and protracted correction in the U.S. housing market, which followed a multiyear boom in housing construction and house prices. Currently, about 21 percent of subprime ARMs are ninety days or more delinquent, and foreclosure rates are rising sharply. Although poor underwriting and, in some cases, fraud and abusive practices contributed to the high rates of delinquency that we are now seeing in the subprime ARM market, the more fundamental reason for the sharp deterioration in credit quality was the flawed premise on which much subprime ARM lending was based: that house prices would continue to rise rapidly. Some lenders, including some who have worked closely with nonprofit groups with strong roots in low-to-moderate-income communities, have been able to foster homeownership in those communities while experiencing exceptionally low rates of default. On the way down, the withdrawal of this source of demand for housing has exacerbated the downturn, adding to the sharp decline in new homebuilding and putting downward pressure on house prices. Investors have also been concerned that, by further weakening the housing sector, the problems in the subprime mortgage market may lead overall economic growth to slow. However, any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed’s inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and reduce the central bank’s policy flexibility to counter shortfalls in growth in the future.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The worst payment problems have been among subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (subprime ARMs); more than one-fifth of the 3.6 million loans outstanding were seriously delinquent at the end of 2007.1  Delinquency rates have also risen for other types of mortgages, reaching 8 percent for subprime fixed-rate loans and 6 percent on adjustable-rate loans securitized in alt-A pools. Other data show that more than 40 percent of the subprime loans in the 2006 vintage had combined loan-to-value ratios in excess of 90 percent, a considerably higher share than earlier in the decade.3  Often, in recent mortgage vintages, small down payments were combined with other risk factors, such as a lack of documentation of sufficient income to make the required loan payments. At the national level, the rise in expected foreclosures could add significantly to the inventory of vacant unsold homes--already at more than 2 million units at the end of 2007--putting further pressure on house prices and housing construction.4 Helping Distressed BorrowersPolicymakers and stakeholders have been working to find effective responses to the increases in delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, the Federal Reserve and other regulators have issued guidance urging lenders and servicers to pursue such arrangements as an alternative to foreclosure when feasible and prudent.5  For the lender or servicer, working out a loan makes economic sense if the net present value (NPV) of the payments under a loss-mitigation strategy exceeds the NPV of payments that would be received in foreclosure.6  Loss mitigation is made more attractive by the fact that foreclosure costs are often substantial. Despite this progress, delinquency and default rates have risen quickly, and servicers report that they are struggling to keep up with the increased volumes.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " At the end of last year, more than one in five of the roughly 3.6 million outstanding subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were seriously delinquent, meaning they were either in foreclosure or ninety days or more past due.1 That rate is about four times higher than it was in mid-2005. Behind these disturbing statistics are families facing personal and financial hardship and neighborhoods that may be destabilized by clusters of foreclosures. In a recent survey, nearly 30 percent of homeowners reported that their houses decreased in value over the past year.2 The decline in home equity makes it more difficult for struggling homeowners to refinance and reduces the financial incentive of stressed borrowers to remain in their homes. Mortgage performance data show a strong correlation between adverse house price changes and subsequent increases in mortgage delinquency and foreclosure (Avery, Brevoort, and Canner, 2007; Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen, 2007). Mortgage delinquencies are also tied to local economic conditions; notably, several midwestern states struggling with job losses and slow income growth have seen increased delinquencies. Consumers going through foreclosure typically will see their credit scores drop, raising longer-term questions about their ability to rebound financially and perhaps pursue a more sustainable home purchase at some later point. ConclusionIt is clear that rising home foreclosures and delinquencies significantly challenge many consumers and communities, and I hope I have conveyed today that the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to fully employing our authority, expertise, and resources to help alleviate their distress.\n",

      " In light of the problems that have arisen in the subprime mortgage market, we are reminded of how critically important it is for individuals to become financially literate at an early age so that they are better prepared to make decisions and navigate an increasingly complex financial marketplace. Financial literacy and consumer education--coupled with robust consumer protection--makes the financial marketplace effective and efficient, and better equips consumers to make tough yet smart financial decisions. I believe more states should consider making personal finance a requirement for all students who seek a high school diploma. I am personally convinced that improving education is vital to the future of our economy and all its citizens, and I strongly believe that promoting financial literacy, in particular, must be a high priority. The Jump$tart Coalition is a leader among organizations seeking to improve the personal financial literacy of students from kindergarten to the university level. In particular, through its biennial survey of high school seniors--the results of which you will hear about shortly--Jump$tart has brought increased attention to the need for greater financial literacy among the youth of our nation. On the regional level, many Federal Reserve Banks work closely with the state coalitions to help achieve this worthy mission. Now, it is with great pleasure that I introduce Laura Levine, executive director of Jump$tart and appointed member of President Bush's recently formed Council on Financial Literacy, who will give a report on the status of financial education of youth in this country.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " When rising delinquencies and losses on mortgages forced the agencies to sharply downgrade many structured credit products, investors lost confidence in those ratings and became unwilling to provide new funds. As I noted earlier, the turmoil in financial markets has also revealed significant weaknesses in the risk-management practices of some large, globally active financial institutions; these weaknesses have exacerbated the problems in the markets by compromising the abilities of these key firms to absorb risk and serve as intermediaries. The supervisors concluded that the firms that suffered the most significant losses tended to exhibit common problems, including insufficiently close monitoring of off-balance-sheet exposures, inadequate attention to the implications for the firm as a whole of risks taken in individual business lines, dependence on a narrow range of risk measures, deficiencies in liquidity planning, and inadequate attention to valuation issues. In the vision set forth by the PWG, however, this model will be rebuilt on a foundation that includes higher standards of underwriting and due diligence, a closer alignment of the incentives of originators and investors, greater transparency and simplicity in the design of credit instruments and in the determination of credit ratings, and better risk and liquidity management by financial institutions that develop and hold these instruments. Indeed, many of the necessary changes that have been identified, including increasing transparency, improving risk management, and attaining better coordination among regulators, could provide important support to the process of normalizing our financial markets.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As a consequence of rising delinquencies, foreclosure proceedings were initiated on some 1.5 million U.S. homes during 2007, up 53 percent from 2006, and the rate of foreclosure starts looks likely to be yet higher in 2008. In good times and bad, a mortgage default can be triggered by a life event, such as the loss of a job, serious illness or injury, or divorce. Figure 3 makes this point more sharply by showing the pattern of increases in delinquency rates between 2004 and 2007, with the largest increases shown in red. Figure 4 shows changes in average annual unemployment rates across counties between 2004 and 2007, with counties indicated in red experiencing increases or only slight decreases in joblessness.3   The data suggest that increases in unemployment rates account for at least some of the recent increases in mortgage delinquencies. However, the behavior of unemployment does not seem sufficient to explain the increased delinquency rates in other areas, including California, Florida, and portions of Colorado, where mortgage delinquencies increased during a period in which unemployment generally decreased. The greater use of these mortgages in the West and East Coasts presumably reflects higher house prices in those regions; again, the geographical pattern suggests that the use of piggyback loans may also have contributed to the recent rise in delinquencies and foreclosures.8 What are the implications of these relationships, particularly the linkage of mortgage payment problems and falling house prices?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But it is worth pointing out briefly that, in fact, the risk of moral hazard did not appear to be Bagehot's principal motivation for recommending a high rate; rather, he saw it as a tool to dissuade unnecessary borrowing and thus to help protect the Bank of England's own finite store of liquid assets.3 Today, potential limitations on the central bank's lending capacity are not nearly so pressing an issue as in Bagehot's time, when the central bank's ability to provide liquidity was far more tenuous. Such forced asset sales can set up a particularly adverse dynamic, in which further substantial price declines fan investor concerns about counterparty credit risk, which then feed back in the form of intensifying funding pressures. Spreads of term dollar Libor over comparable-maturity overnight index swap rates have receded some from their recent peaks but remain abnormally high.4 Funding pressures have also been evident in the strong participation at recent TAF auctions even after the recent expansions in auction sizes, and, of late, depository institutions have borrowed significant amounts under the primary credit program for terms of up to 90 days. A central bank that is too quick to act as liquidity provider of last resort risks inducing moral hazard; specifically, if market participants come to believe that the Federal Reserve or other central banks will take such measures whenever financial stress develops, financial institutions and their creditors would have less incentive to pursue suitable strategies for managing liquidity risk and more incentive to take such risks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Although subprime mortgages are the most well-known instance of underwriting failure and were in some sense the trigger of the turmoil, the loosening of credit standards and terms occurred more broadly, even as market risk premiums contracted. When rising delinquencies and losses on mortgages forced the agencies to sharply downgrade many of these products, investors lost confidence in those ratings and became unwilling to provide new funds. I will return to this topic shortly, but for now, suffice it to say that a result of poor risk management at some financial institutions was that the spreading of risk, one of the purported benefits of the originate-to-distribute model, proved to be much less extensive than many believed. Firms differed in their susceptibility to these problems; however, some were more disciplined in their approaches to identifying and measuring risks and thereby gained a better understanding of the risks of some complex securities, particularly in highly stressed environments. Basel II is intended to enhance the quality of risk management by tying regulatory capital more closely to institutions' underlying risks and by requiring strong internal systems for evaluating credit and other risks. ConclusionTo summarize, the turmoil in credit markets underscores some important principles for bank risk management, including the value of proper risk identification and measurement, the need for robust and objective valuation methods, the importance of preparing for liquidity disruptions, and the critical role of strong oversight by senior managers. With renewed attention to these principles and the restoration of strong incentives for sound risk management, institutions should be able to overcome the difficulties we have seen in the recent application of the originate-to-distribute model and begin to use it successfully again.\n",

      " House prices have shown significant declines in many areas of the country.A second critical development was an even broader credit boom, in which lenders and investors aggressively sought out new opportunities to take credit risk even as market risk premiums contracted. Consumer spending has thus far held up a bit better than expected, but households continue to face significant headwinds, including falling house prices, a softer job market, tighter credit, and higher energy prices, and consumer sentiment has declined sharply since the fall. However, the strength of foreign demand for U.S. goods and services has offset, to some extent, the slowing of domestic sales.Overall economic growth was quite slow but apparently positive in both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of this year. Over time, the Federal Reserve's commitment to both price stability and maximum sustainable employment and the underlying strengths of the U.S. economy--including flexible markets and robust innovation and productivity--will be key factors ensuring that the dollar remains a strong and stable currency.Second, to improve market liquidity and functioning, we have taken a range of measures to ensure that financial institutions have adequate access to central bank liquidity.2  The resulting reductions in funding pressures, together with the increased confidence created by the assurance that backstop liquidity is available to eligible institutions, should help to promote an orderly resolution of current market dislocations. Consumer spending has thus far held up a bit better than expected, but households continue to face significant headwinds, including falling house prices, a softer job market, tighter credit, and higher energy prices, and consumer sentiment has declined sharply since the fall.\n",

      " The economy had just gone through a severe recession, during which output, income, and employment fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose to 9 percent. Moreover, with the controlled price of U.S. crude oil well below world prices, growth in domestic exploration slowed and production was curtailed--which, of course, only made things worse. For the Federal Reserve, two crucial lessons from this experience were, first, that high inflation can seriously destabilize the economy and, second, that the central bank must take responsibility for achieving price stability over the medium term. And until the recent slowdown--which is more the result of conditions in the residential housing market and in financial markets than of higher oil prices--economic growth was solid and unemployment remained low, unlike what we saw following oil price increases in the '70s. Since 1975, the energy required to produce a given amount of output in the United States has fallen by about half.6 This great improvement in energy efficiency was less the result of government programs than of steps taken by households and businesses in response to higher energy prices, including substantial investments in more energy-efficient equipment and means of transportation. In addition, the lowering of trade barriers promoted productivity gains by increasing competition, expanding markets, and increasing the pace of technology transfer.12 Finally, as a central banker, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the contribution of monetary policy to the improved productivity performance.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  Permit me to start with a bit of history that I hope will underscore the crucial role played by the regional Reserve Banks. They both failed to gain the trust of a public fearful of concentrated power. To address this concern, the creators of the Federal Reserve crafted a plan for a central bank with a unique structure: what some have called a decentralized central bank. Thus, in making policy, we are able to view the economy not just from a Washington perspective, or a Wall Street perspective, but also from a Main Street perspective. Nationally, 278 private citizens--including business people, bankers, nonprofit executives, and community, agricultural and labor leaders--serve on the boards of our 12 Banks and their Branches. Often, they provide an early warning of shifting economic conditions before they show up in official government statistics. Those who have an appreciation of U.S. history know that the Federal Reserve played an important role in support of the funding of the First World War and that the war forced the early Federal Reserve to contend with an uncertain global environment with wide-ranging monetary and economic ramifications. Looking at the Federal Reserve more broadly, while we must continue to change, we also must recognize that one of the Federal Reserve's key strengths continues to be the strong regional connections fostered by the Reserve Banks. They were created because of the existence of certain common needs and interests, and they should be administered for the common welfare--for the good of all.\"\n",

      " Per capita expenditures on health care for uninsured individuals are, on average, roughly half those for fully insured individuals.3 People who are uninsured are less likely to receive preventive and screening services, less likely to receive appropriate care to manage chronic illnesses, and more likely to die prematurely from cancer--largely because they tend to be diagnosed when the disease is more advanced.4 One recent study found that uninsured victims of automobile accidents receive 20 percent less treatment in hospitals and are 37 percent more likely to die of their injuries than those who are insured.5 QualityThe second key challenge is improving the quality of health care. Although the high cost of health care is a frequently heard complaint, it is important to note that a substantial portion of the cost increases that we have seen in recent decades reflects improvements in both the quality and quantity of care delivered rather than higher costs of delivering a given level of care. Indeed, although quantifying the economic value of improved health and greater expected longevity is difficult, most researchers who have undertaken an exercise of this type find that, on average, the health benefits of new technologies and other advances have significantly exceeded the economic costs.11 That said, the evidence also suggests that the cost of health care in the United States is greater than necessary to allow us to achieve the levels of health and longevity we now enjoy. For example, increased patient screening may avoid more serious problems and thus be cost-saving, but it could also identify problems that might otherwise have gone untreated--a good outcome, certainly, but one that increases overall spending.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, the ongoing contraction in the housing market and continuing increases in energy prices suggest that growth risks remain to the downside.One of the most effective means by which the Federal Reserve can help to restore moderate growth over time and to reduce the associated downside risks is by supporting the return of financial markets to more-normal functioning. We have seen rapid growth in the worldwide demand for raw materials, which in turn is largely the result of sustained global growth--particularly resources-intensive growth in emerging market economies.1  And factors including inadequate investment, long lags in the development of new capacity, and underlying resource constraints have caused the supplies of a number of important commodity classes, including energy and metals, to lag global demand. Considerable work has also been done on the role of time-varying markups in the inflation process, but a consensus on the role of changing markups on the inflation process remains elusive.5  More research in this area, particularly with an empirical orientation, would be welcome.Real-Time PolicymakingThe measurement issues I just raised point to another important concern of policymakers, namely, the necessity of making decisions in \"real time,\" under conditions of great uncertainty--including uncertainty about the underlying state of the economy--and without the benefit of hindsight. For example, even if the output gap is poorly measured, by taking appropriate account of measurement uncertainties and combining information about the output gap with information from other sources, we may be able to achieve better policy outcomes than would be possible if we simply ignored noisy output gap measures.\n",

      " The decline in the national housing market, which has been a major cause of the broader slowdown in economic activity, was in turn greatly exacerbated by the collapse of subprime lending. If these firms are strong, well-regulated, well-capitalized, and focused on their mission, they will be better able to serve their function of increasing access to mortgage credit, without posing undue risks to the financial system or the taxpayer. Our analyses persuaded us and our colleagues at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Treasury that allowing Bear Stearns to fail so abruptly at a time when the financial markets were already under considerable stress would likely have had extremely adverse implications for the financial system and for the broader economy. In doing so, we aim not only to help make the financial system better able to withstand future shocks but also--by reducing the range of circumstances in which systemic stability concerns might prompt government intervention--to mitigate moral hazard and the problem of \"too big to fail. As I have noted, I believe that the Federal Reserve's actions to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns, thereby preventing its bankruptcy and the disorderly liquidation of positions by its counterparties and creditors, were necessary and warranted to head off serious damage to the U.S. financial system and our economy. As part of its review of how best to increase financial stability, and as has been suggested by Secretary Paulson, the Congress may wish to consider whether new tools are needed for ensuring an orderly liquidation of a systemically important securities firm that is on the verge of bankruptcy, together with a more formal process for deciding when to use those tools.\n",

      " By cushioning the first-round economic impact of the financial stress, we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so-called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress, which, in turn, further damages economic prospects.In view of the weakening outlook and the downside risks to growth, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained a relatively low target for the federal funds rate despite an increase in inflationary pressures. Importantly, as my FOMC colleague Gary Stern has pointed out, it would also mitigate moral hazard and the problem of \"too big to fail\" by reducing the range of circumstances in which systemic stability concerns might be expected by markets to prompt government intervention.4 A statutory resolution regime for nonbanks, besides reducing uncertainty, would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors, analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails.A Systemwide Approach to Supervisory OversightThe regulation and supervisory oversight of financial institutions is another critical tool for limiting systemic risk.

      " As an economist, but also as a former professor, one-time school board member, spouse of a teacher, and parent of two young adults pursuing higher education, I am always glad to have an opportunity to speak about the importance of education to our nation's economy and our society. As our economy becomes more and more technologically advanced and globally interconnected, the skills, knowledge, and analytical ability that education develops are becoming ever more crucial to each individual's success. A substantial body of research demonstrates that investments in education--higher education, certainly, but also lifelong education, from preschool to mid-career training and adult education--pay high rates of return both to individuals and to our society as a whole. Moreover, the benefits of education are more than economic. Research suggests that more-highly-educated individuals are happier on average, make better personal financial decisions, suffer fewer spells of unemployment, and enjoy better health. Educated individuals also are more likely to participate in civic affairs, volunteer their time to charities, and subscribe to personal values--such as tolerance and an appreciation of cultural differences--that are increasingly crucial for the healthy functioning of our diverse society. We must work diligently to maintain the quality of our educational system where it is strong and strive to improve it where it is not. In particular, we must find ways to move more of our students, especially minorities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, into education after high school.\n",

      "  Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has actively used all its powers and authorities to try to help our economy through this difficult time. And central banks around the world have consulted closely and cooperated in unprecedented ways to reduce strains in financial markets and to bolster our economies. However, clearly the time had come for a more comprehensive and broad-based solution. History teaches us that government engagement in times of severe financial crisis often arrives very late, usually at a point at which most financial institutions are insolvent or nearly so. Waiting too long to act has usually led to much greater direct costs of the intervention itself and, more importantly, magnified the painful effects of financial turmoil on households and businesses. Fortunately, the Congress and the Administration have acted at a time when the great majority of financial institutions, though stressed by highly volatile and difficult market conditions, remain capable of fulfilling their critical function of providing new credit for our economy. The Congress's prompt and decisive action in passing the financial rescue legislation made possible the critical steps that have been announced this morning. As in all past crises, at the root of the problem is a loss of confidence by investors and the public in the strength of key financial institutions and markets, which has had cascading and unwelcome effects on the availability of credit and the value of savings. Americans can be confident that every resource is being brought to bear: historical understanding, technical expertise, economic analysis, and political leadership.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In that regard, we are, in one respect at least, better off than those who dealt with earlier financial crises: Generally, during past crises, broad-based government engagement came late, usually at a point at which most financial institutions were insolvent or nearly so. Fortunately, the Congress and the Administration have acted at a time when the great majority of financial institutions, though stressed by highly volatile and difficult market conditions, remain strong and capable of fulfilling their critical function of providing new credit for our economy. Large inflows of capital into the United States and other countries stimulated a reaching for yield, an underpricing of risk, excessive leverage, and the development of complex and opaque financial instruments that seemed to work well during the credit boom but have been shown to be fragile under stress. Notwithstanding our efforts and those of other policymakers, the financial crisis intensified over the summer as mortgage-related assets deteriorated further, economic growth slowed, and uncertainty about the financial and economic outlook increased. As investors and creditors lost confidence in the ability of certain firms to meet their obligations, their access to capital markets as well as to short-term funding markets became increasingly impaired, and their stock prices fell sharply. If the TARP, together with the other measures that have been taken, is successful in promoting financial stability and, consequently, in supporting stronger economic growth and job creation, it will have proved itself a very good investment indeed, to everyone's benefit.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Great uncertainty about the values of financial assets, particularly more complex and opaque assets, has made investors extremely reluctant to bear credit risk, resulting in further declines in asset prices and a drying up of liquidity in a number of funding markets. On the heels of nearly a year of stress in credit markets, investors' and creditors' concerns about funding and credit risks at financial firms intensified over the summer as mortgage-related assets deteriorated further, economic growth slowed, and uncertainty about the economic outlook increased. As investors and creditors lost confidence in the ability of certain firms to meet their obligations, their access to capital markets as well as to short-term funding markets became increasingly impaired and their stock prices fell sharply. In the case of AIG, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury judged that a disorderly failure of AIG would have severely threatened global financial stability and the performance of the U.S. economy. The heightened financial turmoil that we have experienced of late may well lengthen the period of weak economic performance and further increase the risks to growth. If the TARP promotes financial stability, leading ultimately to stronger economic growth and job creation, it will have proved a very good investment indeed, to everyone's benefit. We have learned from historical experience with severe financial crises that if government intervention comes only at a point at which many or most financial institutions are insolvent or nearly so, the costs of restoring the system are greatly increased.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As subsequent events demonstrated, however, the boom in subprime mortgage lending was only a part of a much broader credit boom characterized by an underpricing of risk, excessive leverage, and the creation of complex and opaque financial instruments that proved fragile under stress. To address these issues, we must consider both the part played by securitization in the mortgage market and the role of the government and government-sponsored entities in facilitating securitization.The ability of financial intermediaries to sell the mortgages they originate into the broader capital market by means of the securitization process serves two important purposes:  First, it provides originators much wider sources of funding than they could obtain through conventional sources, such as retail deposits; second, it substantially reduces the originator's exposure to interest rate, credit, prepayment, and other risks associated with holding mortgages to maturity, thereby reducing the overall costs of providing mortgage credit.Developing an effective securitization model is not easy--according to one economic historian, mortgage securitization schemes were tried and abandoned at least six times between 1870 and 1940.1  Eventually, experience provided three principles for successful mortgage securitization. Other benefits are that private entities presumably would be more innovative and efficient than a government agency, and that they could operate with less interference from political interests.However, whether the GSE model is viable without at least implicit government support is an open question. And, although I have noted the problems associated with private-public conflict, that conflict is not always counterproductive; an entity with private shareholders may be better able to resist political influences, which, under some circumstances, may lead to better market outcomes.If private shareholders are excluded, several possibilities worth exploring remain. And, although I have noted the problems associated with private-public conflict, that conflict is not always counterproductive; an entity with private shareholders may be better able to resist political influences, which, under some circumstances, may lead to better market outcomes.\n",

      " In taking these actions, we aimed not only to cushion the direct effects of the financial turbulence on the economy, but also to reduce the risk of a so-called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress, which, in turn, leads to further economic damage. But I am confident that market functioning would have been more seriously impaired in the absence of our actions. My reading of the evidence and the reports we have received is that these programs have been helpful in lowering spreads in certain short-term funding markets, enabling financial and nonfinancial businesses to obtain credit that would have been costly or difficult to obtain elsewhere, and allowing a more orderly process of asset sales and the necessary deleveraging by financial institutions. However, in my view, the failure of a major financial institution at a time when financial markets are already quite fragile poses too great a threat to financial and economic stability to be ignored. Housing markets remain weak, with low demand and the increased number of distressed properties on the market contributing to further declines in house prices and ongoing reductions in new construction. Excluding the effects of the hurricanes and the Boeing strike on production, manufacturing output fell 2 percent over the months of September and October, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods fell markedly in October, and most survey measures of business conditions are at or close to record lows.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As you know, financial markets remain under severe strain. The proximate cause of the financial turmoil was the end of the U.S. housing boom and the attendant losses on mortgages and mortgage-related assets by many institutions. However, more fundamentally, the turmoil was the product of a global credit boom, characterized by a broad underpricing of risk, excessive leverage by financial institutions, and an increasing reliance on complex and opaque financial instruments that have proven to be fragile under stress. Personally, I have found the opportunity to share views regularly with President Trichet and other leading central bankers at various international meetings extremely valuable. In addition, the coordinated rate cut was intended to send a strong signal to the public and to markets of our resolve to act together to address global economic challenges. The Federal Reserve has now established temporary swap lines with more than a dozen other central banks.2 Many of these central banks have drawn on these lines and, using a variety of methods and facilities, have allocated these funds to meet the needs of institutions within their borders.3 Although funding needs during the current turmoil have been the most pronounced for dollars, they have arisen for other currencies as well. The 10th anniversary of the euro is an opportunity not only to celebrate an impressive and historic achievement, but also to reaffirm our commitment to cooperation as we address the challenges of an increasingly integrated global economy.\n",

      " Lower property values in turn translate to lower tax revenues for local governments, and increases in the number of vacant homes can foster vandalism and crime.5  At the national level, the declines in house prices that result from the addition of foreclosed properties to the supply of homes for sale create broader economic and financial stress, as I have already noted.6 On the surface, private economic incentives to avoid foreclosure would appear to be strong for the lender as well as the borrower. Foreclosure dissipates much of the value of the property:  Indeed, recent losses on defaulted subprime mortgages have averaged around 50 to 60 percent of the loan balance.7  Besides the general decline in property values and foregone payments, fees related to foreclosure, such as court costs, maintenance expenses, and others, can amount to 10 to 15 percent of the loan balance; furthermore, the discount in value due to foreclosure status can be an additional 5 to 15 percent.8 However, despite the substantial costs imposed by foreclosure, anecdotal evidence suggests that some foreclosures are continuing to occur even in cases in which the narrow economic interests of the lender would appear to be better served through modification of the mortgage. The regulators recently reiterated that position in a joint statement that encouraged banks to make the necessary investments in staff and capacity to meet the escalating workload and to adopt systematic, proactive, and streamlined modification protocols to put borrowers in sustainable mortgages.10 A number of initiatives have attempted to address the problem of unnecessary foreclosures.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  For almost a year and a half the global financial system has been under extraordinary stress--stress that has now decisively spilled over to the global economy more broadly. The proximate cause of the crisis was the turn of the housing cycle in the United States and the associated rise in delinquencies on subprime mortgages, which imposed substantial losses on many financial institutions and shook investor confidence in credit markets. Aspects of this broader credit boom included widespread declines in underwriting standards, breakdowns in lending oversight by investors and rating agencies, increased reliance on complex and opaque credit instruments that proved fragile under stress, and unusually low compensation for risk-taking. Financial institutions have seen their capital depleted by losses and writedowns and their balance sheets clogged by complex credit products and other illiquid assets of uncertain value. Heightened systemic risks, falling asset values, and tightening credit have in turn taken a heavy toll on business and consumer confidence and precipitated a sharp slowing in global economic activity. However, that offset has been incomplete, as widening credit spreads, more restrictive lending standards, and credit market dysfunction have worked against the monetary easing and led to tighter financial conditions overall. Liquidity provision by the central bank reduces systemic risk by assuring market participants that, should short-term investors begin to lose confidence, financial institutions will be able to meet the resulting demands for cash without resorting to potentially destabilizing fire sales of assets. In addition, efforts to reduce preventable foreclosures, among other benefits, could strengthen the housing market and reduce mortgage losses, thereby increasing financial stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Consequently, the rates of growth of broader monetary aggregates, such as M1 and M2, have been much lower than that of the monetary base.2 At this point, with global economic activity weak and commodity prices at low levels, we see little risk of unacceptably high inflation in the near term; indeed, we expect inflation to be quite low for some time. Later today, with the release of the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting, we will be making an additional significant enhancement in Federal Reserve communications: To supplement the current economic projections by governors and Reserve Bank presidents for the next three years, we will also publish their projections of the longer-term values (at a horizon of, for example, five to six years) of output growth, unemployment, and inflation, under the assumptions of appropriate monetary policy and the absence of new shocks to the economy. These longer-term projections will inform the public of the Committee participants' estimates of the rate of growth of output and the unemployment rate that appear to be sustainable in the long run in the United States, taking into account important influences such as the trend growth rates of productivity and the labor force, improvements in worker education and skills, the efficiency of the labor market at matching workers and jobs, government policies affecting technological development or the labor market, and other factors. Also, increased clarity about the FOMC's views regarding longer-term inflation should help to better stabilize the public's inflation expectations, thus contributing to keeping actual inflation from rising too high or falling too low.\n",

      "  As some of you know, my family ties to Dillon extend back more than six decades. I remember, too, in the summer after I graduated from high school, working construction to help build Saint Eugene Hospital, now McLeod Medical Center, and I remember, during the summers of my college years, waiting tables six days a week at South of the Border. As a teenager, like many teenagers, I itched to get away from the small town in which I grew up. First and foremost, I learned how very hard people in small towns like Dillon, and in communities large and small all across the United States, have to work to support themselves and their families and to offer opportunities to their children. So, in that way and many others, I carry my hometown with me, and it is very good to return, if only for a short visit to accept this honor. But, as I thought about it, I realized that it is indeed a high honor for someone whose job is focused on supporting the economy. Well, neither are the American people, despite the economic challenges we now confront. For our part, at the Federal Reserve, we will continue to forcefully deploy all the tools at our disposal as long as necessary to support the restoration of financial stability and the resumption of healthy economic growth. But even more than the honor itself, I am touched by what it represents--the prayers, good wishes, and support of the people of my home state and hometown.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In that regard, the Federal Reserve has been looking carefully at risk-management practices at systemically important institutions to identify best practices, assess firms' performance, and require improvement where deficiencies are identified.3 Any firm whose failure would pose a systemic risk must receive especially close supervisory oversight of its risk-taking, risk management, and financial condition, and be held to high capital and liquidity standards.4 In light of the global reach and diversified operations of many large financial firms, international supervisors of banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions must collaborate and cooperate on these efforts. Here the aim should be not only to help make the financial system as a whole better able to withstand future shocks, but also to mitigate moral hazard and the problem of too big to fail by reducing the range of circumstances in which systemic stability concerns might prompt government intervention. For example, capital regulations require that banks' capital ratios meet or exceed fixed minimum standards for the bank to be considered safe and sound by regulators.7 Because banks typically find raising capital to be difficult in economic downturns or periods of financial stress, their best means of boosting their regulatory capital ratios during difficult periods may be to reduce new lending, perhaps more so than is justified by the credit environment. We should review capital regulations to ensure that they are appropriately forward-looking, and that capital is allowed to serve its intended role as a buffer--one built up during good times and drawn down during bad times in a manner consistent with safety and soundness.8 In the area of prudential supervision, we should also ensure that bank examiners appropriately balance the need for caution and the benefits of maintaining profitable lending relationships when evaluating bank loan policies.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Looking first at current conditions, higher loan loss provisions and significant realized losses on investment securities--related in many cases to impairment of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac equity holdings--substantially eroded the profitability of community banks in 2008. In the decades leading up to the current crisis, the nature of lending had changed dramatically, with greater industry consolidation, increased economies of scale and scope, and a larger portion of credit being supplied by nonbanks. If left unaddressed, this weakening of market discipline creates an unlevel playing field for smaller institutions, which may not be able to raise funds as cheaply, even if their individual risk profiles are better, or at least no worse, than those of their larger competitors. These actions have involved extremely unpleasant and difficult choices, but given the interconnected nature of our financial system and the potentially devastating effects on confidence, financial markets, and the broader economy that would likely arise from the disorderly failure of a major financial firm in the current environment, I do not think we have had a realistic alternative to preventing such failures. Capital rules, accounting policies, and other regulatory standards should not make this job even more difficult by encouraging excessively procyclical behavior by financial institutions--that is, behavior that causes financial institutions to tighten credit in downturns and ease credit in booms more than is justified by changes in the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The principles I have just noted were recently formalized in a joint Federal Reserve-Treasury statement.1 Those principles are: (1) that the Fed will cooperate closely with the Treasury and other agencies in addressing the financial crisis; (2) that the Fed in its lending activities should avoid taking credit risk or allocating credit to narrowly defined sectors or classes of borrowers; (3) that the Fed's independent ability to manage monetary policy must not be constrained by its programs to ease credit conditions; and (4) that there is a pressing need for a new resolution regime for nonbanks that, among other things, will better define the Fed's role in preventing the disorderly failure of systemically critical financial institutions. The Balance Sheet as a Tool of Monetary PolicyThe severe disruption of credit markets that began late in the summer of 2007 and the associated tightening in credit conditions and declines in asset prices have weighed heavily on economic activity here and abroad. To be sure, the provision of liquidity alone cannot address solvency problems or erase the large losses that financial institutions have suffered during this crisis. Over time, lower mortgage rates should help to improve conditions in the housing market, whose persistent weakness has had a major impact on economic and financial conditions more broadly, and will improve the financial condition of some households by facilitating refinancing. I am confident that we can meet these challenges, not least because I have great confidence in the underlying strengths of the American economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In the communities in which you and I grew up, many families are trying to cope with lost employment and depleted savings or are facing foreclosure on their homes. Lenders may have become careless because they, like many people at the time, expected that house prices would continue to rise--thereby allowing borrowers to build up equity in their homes--and that credit would remain easily available, so that borrowers would be able to refinance if necessary. At the peak of the crisis last fall, many people who had invested in money market mutual funds lost confidence in those funds and withdrew their money; this loss of funding forced money market mutual funds to reduce their own investments, which in turn caused serious problems in the commercial paper market. Many other serious consequences would have followed from a default by AIG: Insurance policyholders would have faced considerable uncertainty about the status of their policies; state and local governments, which had lent more than $10 billion to AIG, would have suffered losses; workers whose 401(k) plans had purchased $40 billion of insurance from AIG against the risk of loss would have seen that insurance disappear; and holders of AIG's substantial quantities of commercial paper would have also borne serious losses. Historical experience shows that, once begun, a financial panic can spread rapidly and unpredictably; indeed, the failure of Lehman Brothers a day earlier, which the Fed and the Treasury unsuccessfully tried to prevent, resulted in the freezing up of a wide range of credit markets, with extremely serious consequences for the world economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I think that perception goes too far, and innovation, at its best, has been and will continue to be a tool for making our financial system more efficient and more inclusive. As secondary mortgage markets--an important innovation in themselves--grew, they gave lenders both greater access to funding and better ability to diversify, providing further impetus to expansion into new markets and new products. Card issuers benefited by spreading fixed costs over multiple advances of credit, over larger customer bases, across geographic areas, and among many merchants.3 From the consumer's perspective, credit cards provided convenience, facilitated recordkeeping, and offered security from loss (by theft, for example).4 Their use gradually expanded among American families, rising to 43 percent in 1983 and to 70 percent by 2007. As I have already mentioned, the ongoing growth and development of the secondary mortgage market reinforced the effect of these innovations, giving mortgage lenders greater access to the capital markets, lowering transaction costs, and spreading risk more broadly. Some studies of mortgage lending outcomes, after controlling for borrower characteristics, have found elevated levels of default associated with certain loan features, including adjustable rates and prepayment penalties, as well as with certain origination channels, including broker originations.7 Although these results are not conclusive, they suggest that complexity may diminish consumers' ability to identify products appropriate to their circumstances. It seems clear that the difficulty of managing financial innovation in the period leading up to the crisis was underestimated, and not just in the case of consumer lending.\n",

      " A practitioner, like me, of the dismal science of economics--and it is even more dismal than usual these days--is not usually the first choice for providing inspiration and uplift. Any time that you challenge yourself to undertake something worthwhile but difficult, a little out of your comfort zone--or any time that you put yourself in a position that challenges your preconceived sense of your own limits--you increase your capacity to make the most of the unexpected opportunities with which you will inevitably be presented. Each of you is a different person than you were three years ago, not only more knowledgeable in the law, but also possessing a greater understanding of who you are--your weaknesses and strengths, your goals and aspirations. During my time as a professor, I tried to resist the powerful forces pushing scholars to greater and greater specialization and instead did my best to keep as broad a perspective as possible. The financial crisis that began in August 2007 is the most severe since the Great Depression, and it has been the principal cause of the global recession that began last fall. Although I never could have prepared in advance for the specific events of the past 21 months, I believe that my efforts throughout my life to expand my horizons and to keep a broad perspective--for example, to study and write about economic and financial history, as well as more conventional topics in macroeconomics and monetary economics--have helped me better meet the challenges that have come my way. Our educational system is strong in some areas, including our university system, but does not serve everyone equally well, contributing to slower growth and greater income disparities.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " These efforts averted serious threats to global financial stability last fall and have contributed to gradual improvement in key credit markets, though many markets remain stressed. Today, following the significant weakening in the global economy that began last fall, concerns have shifted to more-traditional credit risks, including rising delinquencies on prime as well as subprime mortgages, unpaid credit card and auto loans, worsening conditions in commercial real estate markets, and increased rates of corporate bankruptcy. To make this assessment, we began by stipulating a hypothetical, adverse economic scenario, under which growth, unemployment, and house-price outcomes were assumed to be more unfavorable than those implied by the consensus of private-sector forecasters. We released a white paper on April 24 describing the process and methodology.1 On May 6, we provided more information on the measures used to size the required capital buffer, as well as a preview of the information that would be disclosed.2 The final release of results, this past Thursday, May 7, included the supervisory-determined indicative loss rates that were used in evaluating firm submissions, and, most importantly, aggregate and firm-specific estimates for losses, loss rates, resources to absorb losses, and the resulting capital buffer needs.3 Finally, as I have noted, the assessment was forward-looking. The baseline scenario reflected the consensus expectation for the economy among professional forecasters as of February 2009, and the more adverse scenario incorporated the possibility that the recession could be more severe than the consensus expectation and that house prices could fall even more sharply. In particular, estimated loss rates for mortgage and consumer credit are high, reflecting the combination of high unemployment and steep declines in house prices that were specified in the more adverse scenario.\n",

      "  After more than a year and a half of financial crisis, both bankers and policymakers must contend with two questions: What have we learned from this extraordinary episode? In my remarks today I will outline some steps that the Federal Reserve has already taken in the wake of the crisis to strengthen capital, liquidity, and risk management in the banking sector, as well as to improve the supervisory process itself. Among other things, our analysis reaffirms that capital adequacy, effective liquidity planning, and strong risk management are essential for safe and sound banking; the crisis revealed serious deficiencies on the part of some financial institutions in one or more of the areas. For instance, we have emphasized to banks the importance of stress testing to help detect risks not identified by more-typical statistical models, such as abnormally large market moves, evaporation of liquidity, prolonged periods of market distress, or structural changes in markets. As I noted in a speech last month, financial innovation can benefit consumers, the financial system, and the broader economy, but it also has risks that must be properly understood.6 Indeed, as you know, financial innovations in areas such as structured credit products and mortgage lending in some degree helped precipitate the current crisis. Drawing on a particularly important lesson of the crisis, our supervisors are emphasizing to institutions that maintaining strong risk-management practices is at least as important in good times as in bad. It is precisely during those good times, when risks appear low and the financial horizon seems clear, that financial market participants can become overly optimistic and make costly mistakes.\n",

      " The rationale for such research has certainly been underscored by the financial crisis that began in August 2007 and the powerful adverse effects of the crisis on economic activity around the globe.Although the existing research literature has been invaluable in providing analytical and empirical tools for interpreting recent developments and for setting the course of policy, these developments have also highlighted how much additional research is needed on this topic. Several papers formulate empirically realistic macroeconomic models in which credit market frictions play a prominent role in the transmission of monetary policy to economic activity and inflation.2 Two other papers analyze the extent to which these transmission channels are affected by international linkages among financial markets and institutions.3 Another pair of papers investigate the behavior of risk premiums that compensate investors for uncertainty about the real economy and inflation outcomes.4 Finally, two papers analyze the implications of credit market frictions for the optimal design of monetary policy.5Of course, the discussants' remarks, the general discussions, and the policy panel will surely be very helpful in identifying fruitful directions for further research.

      " While many CDFI portfolios have continued to hold up relatively well despite the financial crisis, rates of delinquencies and defaults on CDFI loans have risen as economic conditions have worsened.8 In light of the mission of CDFIs, it is not surprising that their financial concerns often reflect economic distress in the broader community: the once-thriving local business that is shutting its doors, the affordable rental housing complex that is struggling to make payments as tenants lose jobs and fall behind, and the after-school youth center that cannot repay its loan because its donor base has shrunk. Even as the capacity of CDFIs has become more constrained, economic conditions and pullbacks by mainstream lenders have increased the demands being placed on these organizations to provide credit and services.9 Traditionally, CDFIs have been able to fund a majority of their operating activities through earnings.10 However, those earnings have come under pressure as loan losses have risen, deal volumes have declined, and sources of capital for new activities have become more expensive or unavailable altogether. Funding from philanthropic sources has been reduced as endowments have suffered capital losses and rates of giving have declined.11 Indeed, two-thirds of foundations surveyed recently reported that they plan to reduce the number and size of their grants in 2009, and cuts are expected to continue in 2010 and beyond.12 Funding from state and local governments that sometimes support CDFIs is also dwindling, reflecting increased fiscal pressures. As many communities struggle with rising unemployment, high rates of foreclosures, and vacant homes and stores, these organizations lead efforts to stabilize their neighborhoods.\n",

      "  I am pleased to lead off this distinguished group in congratulating the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on its 125th anniversary. The legislation creating the BLS had its roots in several important and lasting shifts in our nation's political landscape during the late 19th century. The first shift was heightened concern about the material well-being of working men and women. Thus, from its start, the BLS was poised for a solid tradition of public service. As a past and present consumer of the bureau's products, I want to thank you for your excellent work. As you know, in conducting monetary policy, the Federal Reserve aims for maximum employment and price stability. To achieve those goals, we must formulate policy based on our best assessment of where the economy is heading. Clearly, the timeliness and reliability of your labor market and price reports are critical to us. We need to understand productivity because it is a key element in determining how fast the economy can expand without generating inflation. And we need to factor in trends in wages and benefits, in consumer spending, and in how U.S. wage, price, and productivity trends compare with those abroad. Researchers' insights have led to better analysis and higher quality data.

      " Notwithstanding this noteworthy progress, critical challenges remain: Strains persist in many financial markets across the globe, financial institutions face significant additional losses, and many businesses and households continue to experience considerable difficulty gaining access to credit. The historically most familiar type of panic, which involves runs on banks by retail depositors, has been made largely obsolete by deposit insurance or guarantees and the associated government supervision of banks.13 But a panic is possible in any situation in which longer-term, illiquid assets are financed by short-term, liquid liabilities, and in which suppliers of short-term funding either lose confidence in the borrower or become worried that other short-term lenders may lose confidence.14,15 Although, in a certain sense, a panic may be collectively irrational, it may be entirely rational at the individual level, as each market participant has a strong incentive to be among the first to the exit. These forced sales drive down asset prices, increase volatility, and weaken the financial positions of all holders of similar assets, which in turn increases the risks borne by repo lenders and thus the haircuts they demand.16 This unstable dynamic was apparent around the time of the near-failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008, and haircuts rose particularly sharply during the worsening of the crisis in mid-September.17 As we saw last fall, when a vicious funding spiral of this sort is at work, falling asset prices and the collapse of lender confidence may create financial contagion, even between firms without significant counterparty relationships.\n",

      " Thank you for the opportunity to speak during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference. Congresswoman Waters, I appreciate the invitation and your leadership in this area. As you know, in response to the financial crisis that began more than two years ago, the Federal Reserve has introduced various programs to improve the functioning of key financial markets, with the goal of helping to restore the flow of credit that our economy needs. Usage of many of these programs has been winding down as markets improve, but one program for which an ongoing need still clearly exists is the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. Securitization markets are an important source of credit, and their virtual shutdown during the crisis has reduced credit availability for many borrowers. TALF was designed from the start to be available to a diverse set of participants: TALF loans to purchase asset-backed securities are available to virtually any U.S.-domiciled firm, and firms can participate with investments as low as $500,000. At that summit, we heard that a more diverse set of TALF agents would help bring in a more diverse set of TALF borrowers. Acting on that good suggestion, we recently announced the inclusion of four new TALF agents, selected to increase the diversity of TALF borrowers. This initiative supports minority-owned depository institutions through outreach and technical assistance and by training examiners to better understand some of the unique challenges faced by minority-owned institutions.\n",

      "  To fight a recession, the standard prescription for a central bank is to lower its target short-term interest rate, thereby easing financial conditions and supporting economic growth. Since late 2007, however, the share of our assets made up of Treasury securities has declined, while our holdings of other financial assets have expanded dramatically. The provision of short-term liquidity is, of course, a longstanding function of central banks, and--as we know from Bagehot and earlier authors--a principal tool for arresting financial panics.4 Indeed, when short-term funding markets deteriorated abruptly in August 2007, the Federal Reserve's first response was to try to increase the liquidity available to the market by lowering the rate charged for discount window loans and by making it easier for banks to borrow at term. The final row of slide 2 shows that credit outstanding under the Federal Reserve programs aimed at stopping the run on money funds has also dropped essentially to zero.6 The unstinting provision of liquidity by the central bank is crucial for arresting a financial panic. All that said, we undertook these operations with great discomfort and only because the United States has no workable legal framework for winding down systemically critical financial institutions in a way that would allow firms to fail and their creditors to lose money without inflicting massive damage on the financial system. The Administration and other regulatory agencies have joined the Federal Reserve in calling on the Congress to develop a special resolution regime for systemically critical nonbank financial institutions, analogous to one already in place for banks, that could be invoked when the impending failure of such institutions threatens financial stability. ConclusionBy using our balance sheet, the Federal Reserve has been able to overcome, at least partially, the constraints on policy posed by dysfunctional credit markets and by the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate target.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For both Asia and the United States, perhaps the greatest medium-term challenge is to achieve more balanced growth and, in the process, to further reduce global imbalances. Asia's Experience in the CrisisDuring the years following the financial crisis of the late 1990s, many emerging market economies, in Asia and elsewhere, took advantage of relatively good global economic conditions to strengthen their economic and financial fundamentals; they improved their fiscal and external debt positions, built foreign exchange reserves, and reformed their banking sectors. Exhibit 3 shows the relationship between rates of GDP growth during the downturn, relative to trend, and financial openness, as measured by the sum of each country's international assets and liabilities relative to its GDP.7   The exhibit shows that, for both Asian and non-Asian economies, financial openness was associated with greater declines in output, though the linkage appears somewhat less tight than that for trade.8   Again, the most extreme cases are Singapore and especially Hong Kong (which is not shown, as it is more than twice as open as even Singapore). Because strong export markets helped Asia recover from that crisis, and because many countries in the region were badly hurt by sharp reversals in capital flows, the crisis strengthened Asia's commitment to export-led growth, backed up with large current account surpluses and mounting foreign exchange reserves. To achieve more balanced and durable economic growth and to reduce the risks of financial instability, we must avoid ever-increasing and unsustainable imbalances in trade and capital flows. Although we should deploy, as best we can, tools to increase private saving, the most effective way to accomplish this goal is by establishing a sustainable fiscal trajectory, anchored by a clear commitment to substantially reduce federal deficits over time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Notably, to promote financial stability and to address the extremely serious problem posed by firms perceived as \"too big to fail,\" legislative action is needed to create new mechanisms for oversight of the financial system as a whole; to ensure that all systemically important financial firms are subject to effective consolidated supervision; and to establish procedures for winding down a failing, systemically critical institution without seriously damaging the financial system and the economy. The Federal Reserve has just issued proposed guidance that would require banking organizations to review their compensation practices to ensure they do not encourage excessive risk-taking, are subject to effective controls and risk management, and are supported by strong corporate governance including board-level oversight.7 A fundamental element of effective financial regulation is protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. As I noted earlier, the events of the past two years revealed serious failures in risk management at regulated financial firms that, in turn, underscored the need for supervisors to identify weaknesses in a more timely way and to more effectively ensure financial institutions remedy the problems. Strengthening consolidated supervision, setting up a mechanism (such as a systemic oversight council) to identify and monitor risks to financial stability, and creating a framework that allows for the safe unwinding of failing, systemically critical firms are among the essential ingredients of a new system that will reduce the probability of future crises and greatly mitigate the severity of any that occur.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " On the other hand, those who are more optimistic point to indications of more fundamental improvements, including strengthening consumer spending outside of autos, a nascent recovery in home construction, continued stabilization in financial conditions, and stronger growth abroad. Second, with loan losses still high and difficult to predict in the current environment, and with further uncertainty attending how regulatory capital standards may change, banks are being especially conservative in taking on more risk. Demand for commercial property has dropped as the economy has weakened, leading to significant declines in property values, increased vacancy rates, and falling rents. Moreover, the banking agencies recently encouraged banks to work with their creditworthy borrowers to restructure troubled CRE loans in a prudent manner, and reminded examiners that--absent other adverse factors--a loan should not be classified as impaired based solely on a decline in collateral value.5 The Job Market       In addition to constrained bank lending, a second area of great concern is the job market. Since December 2007, the U.S. economy has lost, on net, about 8 million private-sector jobs, and the unemployment rate has risen from less than 5 percent to more than 10 percent.6 Both the decline in jobs and the increase in the unemployment rate have been more severe than in any other recession since World War II.7 Besides cutting jobs, many employers have reduced hours for the workers they have retained.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Having faced the most serious financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression, our economy has made important progress during the past year. By the middle of this year, however, inventories had been sufficiently reduced to encourage firms in a wide range of industries to begin increasing output again, contributing to the recent upturn in the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).2 Although the working down of inventories has encouraged production, a sustainable recovery requires renewed growth in final sales. Economic forecasts are subject to great uncertainty, but my best guess at this point is that we will continue to see modest economic growth next year--sufficient to bring down the unemployment rate, but at a pace slower than we would like. In November 2008 we joined with other banking regulators to urge banks to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers--to the benefit of both the economy and the banks--and we have recently provided guidelines to banks for working constructively with troubled commercial real estate loans.4 This spring, we led a coordinated, comprehensive examination of 19 of the country's largest banks, an exercise formally known as the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, but more informally as the \"stress test.\" Imposing losses on creditors of troubled, systemically critical firms would help address the too-big-to-fail problem by restoring market discipline and leveling the playing field for smaller firms, while minimizing the disruptive effects of a failure on the financial system and the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  The financial crisis that began in August 2007 has been the most severe of the post-World War II era and, very possibly--once one takes into account the global scope of the crisis, its broad effects on a range of markets and institutions, and the number of systemically critical financial institutions that failed or came close to failure--the worst in modern history. For our part, the Federal Reserve has been working hard to identify problems and to improve and strengthen our supervisory policies and practices, and we have advocated substantial legislative and regulatory reforms to address problems exposed by the crisis. Real gross domestic product (GDP), which normally grows above trend in the early stages of an economic expansion, rose at an average pace just above 2 percent in 2002 and the first half of 2003, a rate insufficient to halt continued increases in the unemployment rate, which peaked above 6 percent in the first half of 2003.3 Second, the FOMC's policy response also reflected concerns about a possible unwelcome decline in inflation. The downward slope of the relationship is as expected--countries in which current accounts worsened and capital inflows rose (shown in the left half of the figure) had greater house price appreciation over this period.18 However, in contrast to the previous slide, the relationship is highly significant, both statistically and economically, and about 31percent of the variability in house price appreciation across countries is explained.19 This simple relationship requires more interpretation before any strong conclusions about causality can be drawn; in particular, we need to understand better why some countries drew stronger capital inflows than others.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In many respects, this period has shown this institution at its finest, as we moved rapidly, forcefully, and creatively to confront the deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression and help prevent a looming economic collapse. This swift and effective response would not have been possible without the remarkable dedication, professionalism, and personal sacrifices of the Federal Reserve staff. On the economic front, the resumption of growth in the nation's output of goods and services is encouraging. But far too many people remain unemployed, foreclosures continue at record rates, and bank credit continues to contract. We at the Federal Reserve cannot hope to solve all these problems on our own--other policymakers and those in the private sector must do their part--but we must continue to do all that we can to ensure that our policies are helping to guide the country's return to prosperity in an environment of price stability. At the Federal Reserve and other agencies, the crisis revealed weaknesses and gaps in the regulation and supervision of financial institutions and financial markets. Working together, the Fed staff and the Board have made considerable progress in identifying problems and improving how we carry out our oversight responsibilities. I look forward to continuing to work with all of you to strengthen our economy and to make the Federal Reserve as effective as it can possibly be in advancing the economic wellbeing of all Americans.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Communities all over America are trying to cope with the economic consequences of the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression--high unemployment, lost incomes and wealth, home foreclosures, strained fiscal budgets, and uncertainty about the future. Implementing supervision in a way that seeks to identify systemic risks as well as risks to individual institutions is a difficult challenge, but the fact is that the traditional approach of focusing narrowly on individual firms did not succeed in preventing this crisis and likely would not succeed in the future. Consequently, we at the Federal Reserve have been working with international colleagues to require that the most systemically critical firms increase their holdings of capital and liquidity and improve their risk management; and we are overhauling our supervisory framework for the largest institutions, both to improve the effectiveness of consolidated supervision and to incorporate in our oversight a more comprehensive, systemic perspective. Limiting the fallout from the failure of a major firm is not only directly beneficial in a crisis, it also helps to reduce the too-big-to-fail problem, because the government has much less reason to intervene if it believes that the financial system is resilient enough to handle a significant failure without excessive disruption. As the FDIC is now able to do with a failing bank, the government should, under appropriate circumstances and with appropriate safeguards, be able to seize and wind down a failing, systemically critical firm.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In part because large flows of capital into the United States drove down the returns available on many traditional long-term investments, such as Treasury bonds, investors' appetite for alternative investments--such as loans to finance corporate mergers or commercial real estate projects--increased greatly in the years leading up to the crisis. Together with other direct or indirect exposures to risky debt, these commitments left financial institutions dangerously exposed to rising losses. However, with the financial system already teetering on the brink of collapse, the disorderly failure of AIG, the world's largest insurance company, would have undoubtedly led to even greater financial chaos and a far deeper economic slump than the very severe one we have experienced. They expanded deposit insurance, injected public capital into banks, guaranteed bank-issued debt, and increased access to funding from central banks.1 This strong and unprecedented response--a sharp contrast to the failures of international cooperation that helped make the depression of the 1930s so devastating‑‑proved broadly effective. Importantly, these programs--most of which have been deemed no longer necessary and shut down--not only helped stabilize financial conditions and restart the flow of credit to American families and businesses, they did so at no financial cost to taxpayers and with no credit losses. Most important, the economy has stabilized and is growing again, although we can hardly be satisfied when 1 out of every 10 U.S. workers is unemployed and family finances remain under great stress. However, as I said, our options under extremely difficult circumstances were bad and worse, as our ability to respond effectively was sharply limited by the lack of tools available to act in a crisis.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " First, economic prosperity depends on financial stability; second, policymakers must respond forcefully, creatively, and decisively to severe financial crises; third, crises that are international in scope require an international response; and fourth, unfortunately, history is never a perfect guide. Indeed, the Treasury Secretary at the time, Andrew Mellon, believed in the tonic effects of weeding out weak banks and famously advised President Herbert Hoover, \"Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate … It will purge the rottenness out of the system. Indeed, in a historical context, some of my own research on the Great Depression showed that countries such as the United States that, for institutional or other reasons, suffered severe banking problems, had significantly worse depressions than countries in which the banking system was more stable, such as Great Britain.2 The lesson has been learned. As a result, although the economic consequences of the financial crisis have been painfully severe, the world was spared an even worse cataclysm that could have rivaled or surpassed the Great Depression. Some of his experiments failed or were counterproductive, but his decisions to declare a bank holiday upon taking office in March 1933 and to sever the link between the dollar and gold helped arrest the descent of the U.S. financial system and set off a strong, albeit incomplete, recovery. For its part, the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve, sharply and proactively cut its target for short-term interest rates from the fall of 2007 through 2008.\n",

      "  It is a distinct pleasure to visit with the National Bankers Association Foundation this evening. I am very pleased to be among your honorees. Many American families are struggling in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which reinforces the need for reliable and useful information to facilitate good financial choices. Helping people better understand how to borrow and save wisely and how to build personal wealth is one of the best things we can do to improve the well-being of families and communities. The foundation is making great contributions to this effort, for example, through your online library of personal finance educational materials.1 The Federal Reserve very much shares your abiding interest in helping consumers successfully navigate the financial marketplace. Second, recognizing that basic financial knowledge is not sufficient to keep people safe from fraud and deceptive practices, we are committed to developing and enforcing strong rules to protect consumers. I should note that in recent years we have used extensive consumer testing, both to improve financial disclosures and to highlight practices that simply cannot be understood by consumers even with the best disclosures and thus must be prohibited. We've also stepped up our consumer protection supervision and enforcement, including at the nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations. I would also like to recognize and congratulate the others honored this evening--John Bryant, founder of Operation Hope; the late Jack Kemp, who served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and as congressman of western New York; and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas.\n",

      "  A sound currency is the bedrock of a sound economy. Therefore, the United States government must stay ahead of counterfeiters and protect the integrity of our currency. The three agencies represented here today all share this important responsibility, and today we come together to unveil the latest phase in our efforts--the new design for the $100 note. Since the U.S. notes first issued by the Treasury Department in 1862, our national currency has played an integral role in the fortunes of our country. The Federal Reserve only assumed responsibility for issuing U.S. currency following the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Together with our partners at the Treasury Department, its Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the United States Secret Service, we continuously monitor the counterfeiting threats for each denomination, and make redesign decisions based on these threats. This job has become more complex in recent years as technology advances and U.S. dollar flows expand and increase. In just the past 25 years, the value of Federal Reserve notes in circulation has grown from $180 billion to $890 billion, an increase of almost 400 percent. And while in the past, most U.S. dollars were held domestically, today many of these notes circulate outside of our borders. This global public education program is crucial to the successful introduction of the new $100 note, because a well-informed public is our first and best line of defense against counterfeiting.\n",

      " Rich countries also generally provide people more leisure time, less physically exhausting and more interesting work, higher education levels, greater ability to travel, and more funding for arts and culture.2 Again, these linkages, together with the benefits of enjoying a wide variety of goods and services, are the reason that economic policymakers--at the behest of the public--usually put heavy emphasis on job creation and growth. And, indeed, economists researching happiness and life satisfaction have found that both inflation and unemployment detract from happiness, consistent with the focus on these macroeconomic conditions in the mandate of the Federal Reserve.3 Even though I hope I have persuaded you that purely economic measures of personal well-being are not as narrow as sometimes thought, I have so far dodged the key questions: Ultimately, what makes us happy? \", about 90 percent of respondents in the United States reply that they are very happy or pretty happy, a relatively high percentage.4 Perhaps people don't want to admit to survey-takers that they are unhappy, but the explanation preferred by most researchers is that human beings are intrinsically very adaptable and are able to find satisfaction in their lives even in very difficult circumstances. The finding that people in rich countries don't report much greater happiness than those in lower-income countries--even though, in any given country, the rich say they are happier than the poor do--is called the Easterlin paradox, after its discoverer.5 Now, research in social science is hardly ever the final word, and a large body of more recent research has contested Easterlin's results, finding that people in rich countries may, on average, be happier or more satisfied after all.\n",

      " Objectives and Design of the Supervisory Capital Assessment ProgramIn February 2009, against a backdrop of severe strains in the financial system and a sharply contracting economy, the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the other U.S. banking agencies, launched a simultaneous and comprehensive test of the health of the largest banking organizations in the country. Importantly, the concerns about banking institutions arose not only because market participants expected steep losses on banking assets, but also because the range of uncertainty surrounding estimated loss rates, and thus future earnings, was exceptionally wide. The stress assessment was designed both to ensure that banks would have enough capital in the face of potentially large losses and to reduce the uncertainty about potential losses and earnings prospects. As it turned out, we now can see that the assessment in fact met its objectives of reducing uncertainty about losses and ensuring sufficient capital in the largest banking firms, and that the public disclosure was an important reason for its success. However, with those caveats, it is encouraging that, through the end of last year, the revenues of the SCAP banks have collectively reached about 60 percent of the two-year estimates under the more adverse scenario while loan losses are at only about 40 percent of estimates. We also need a strong resolution framework that allows policymakers to wind down failing, systemically important financial institutions without a destabilizing bankruptcy and without a taxpayer bailout.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The exceptional increase in the deficit has in large part reflected the effects of the weak economy on tax revenues and spending, along with the costs of policy actions taken to ease the recession and steady financial markets. Moreover, as debt and deficits grow, so will the associated interest payments, an obligation that in turn further increases projected deficits. The aging of the U.S. population will also strain the Social Security program, as the number of individuals expected to be working and paying taxes into the system is rising more slowly than the number of people projected to be receiving benefits. The commission will have the difficult job of weighing the economic, social, and other benefits of these programs and comparing the implications of cuts in these areas against other means of closing the fiscal gap. High levels of debt also decrease the ability of policymakers to respond to future economic and financial shocks; indeed, a loss of investor confidence in the ability of a government to achieve fiscal sustainability can itself be a source of significant economic and financial instability, as we have seen in a number of countries in recent decades. But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time. Conclusion       The path forward contains many difficult tradeoffs and choices, but postponing those choices and failing to put the nation's finances on a sustainable long-run trajectory would ultimately do great damage to our economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In earlier crises, foreign investors were not inclined to give emerging market policymakers the benefit of the doubt when they promised low inflation and sustainable fiscal policies. As a result, monetary policymakers in emerging markets often reacted to crises--such as the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s--by raising rather than lowering policy rates, in order to defend the value of the currency, slow capital flight, and bolster the credibility of monetary policy. Currency and maturity mismatches were important problems for several countries during the Asian crisis, as they made financial conditions in these countries vulnerable to a loss of confidence by investors. In the emerging market economies, these disturbances manifested themselves principally in terms of volatile capital flows, with capital outflows earlier in the crisis and capital inflows today each creating significant financial and economic challenges. Yet another challenge for central banks will be to make good use of what we learned during the crisis--to determine whether and how the toolkit of central banks can be expanded, and to find ways to build on central bank cooperation during the crisis to develop stronger working relationships and collaboration in the future. But even as central banks develop new tools to address new challenges, they must continue to place great weight on the factors that have been shown to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of monetary policy: central bank independence, accountability and transparency, and effective communication.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  The financial crisis that began nearly three years ago has caused great hardship for people in many parts of the world and represented the most profound challenge to central banks since the Great Depression. In the United States, we lowered the federal funds rate target to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent to help mitigate the economic downturn; we expanded the scale, scope, and maturity of our lending to provide needed liquidity to financial institutions and to address dislocations in financial markets; we jointly established currency swap lines with foreign central banks (including the Bank of Japan) to ensure the global availability of dollar funding; and we purchased a large quantity of longer-term securities to help improve the functioning of financial markets and support economic recovery.1 Looking to the future, central banks around the world are working with their governments to prevent future crises by strengthening frameworks for financial regulation and supervision. Thus, lack of independence of the central bank can lead to higher inflation and inflation expectations in the longer run, with no offsetting benefits in terms of greater output or employment.3 Additionally, in some situations, a government that controls the central bank may face a strong temptation to abuse the central bank's money-printing powers to help finance its budget deficit. Nearly two centuries ago, the economist David Ricardo argued: \"It is said that Government could not be safely entrusted with the power of issuing paper money; that it would most certainly abuse it.…There would, I confess, be great danger of this, if Government--that is to say, the ministers--were themselves to be entrusted with the power of issuing paper money. The greater clarity and reduced uncertainty, in turn, increase the ability of policymakers to influence economic growth and inflation.15 Over the years, the Federal Reserve--like many central banks around the world--has taken significant steps to improve its transparency and accountability.\n",

      " Following a sharp contraction in late 2008 and early 2009, we are now in the fourth quarter of economic expansion, with jobs once more being created rather than destroyed. One particularly difficult issue is the continued high rate of unemployment. I raise this issue here because healthy small businesses, including start-ups as well as going concerns, are crucial to creating jobs and improving employment security. Indeed, outstanding loans to small businesses dropped from almost $700 billion in the second quarter of 2008 to approximately $660 billion in the first quarter of 2010.1 An important but difficult-to-answer question is how much of this reduction has been driven by weaker demand for loans from small businesses and how much by restricted credit availability. For example, some potential borrowers have been turned down because lending terms and conditions remain tighter than before the financial crisis, perhaps reflecting banks' concerns about the effects of the recession on borrowers' economic prospects and balance sheets. For example, our most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggests that, for the first time since the crisis began in 2007, most banks have stopped tightening credit standards.3 We also know, from the survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business that while only 8 percent of small businesses list access to credit as their principal immediate economic problem, just 40 percent of small businesses attempting to borrow in 2009 had all of their credit needs met.4 Surveys like the two I just mentioned are informative, but getting a full picture also requires hearing from knowledgeable people with diverse perspectives on these issues.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Our objective in organizing this series was to gather information that we and others can use to help develop policies that will support the flow of loans to creditworthy small businesses--for instance, by identifying and addressing specific credit gaps or impediments to lending or improving the access of small businesses to critical support services, including assistance in filing loan applications. For example, the net percentage of survey respondents telling the National Federation of Independent Business that credit conditions have tightened over the prior three months has remained extremely elevated by historical standards.3 And one measure of banks' loans to small businesses dropped from more than $710 billion in the second quarter of 2008 to less than $670 billion in the first quarter of 2010.4 An important but difficult-to-answer question is, How much of this reduction has been driven by weaker demand for loans from small businesses, how much by a deterioration in the financial condition of small businesses during the economic downturn, and how much by restricted credit availability? The insights we obtained from small business owners, lenders, and others in this series of meetings have given us a more nuanced understanding of the problem and will help us identify areas where we might be able to do more. Business owners cited credit lines and working capital as their most critical financial needs, followed by refinancing products that would permit them to take advantage of low interest rates. But, though some lenders said they were emphasizing cash flow and relying less on collateral values in evaluating creditworthiness, it seems clear that some creditworthy businesses--including some whose collateral has lost value but whose cash flows remain strong--have had difficulty obtaining the credit that they need to expand, and in some cases, even to continue operating.\n",

      " I'm pleased to be here today to learn firsthand about the variety of workforce development initiatives in Virginia. Although our country continues to endure high unemployment, we see some signs of modest improvement in the labor market. Partnerships like the Workforce Alliance, and programs at other community colleges, are crucial to ensuring that Americans are able to advance their careers or find work after losing a job in what has been a very challenging economic time. As the labor market recovers, innovative workforce development programs can play important roles in anticipating future job market demands and by helping workers improve their skills to meet the requirements of businesses as they adopt more advanced technologies. Community colleges have the flexibility to provide their students a range of non-degree training opportunities--including counseling, certificate programs, and refresher courses--as well as more formal degree programs. And they make it easier for individuals who are already in the workforce or who have family demands to take advantage of training on a part-time basis.1 Although forecasting future job opportunities can be difficult, we do know that in some areas, such as health services, the number of jobs continued to increase throughout the recession. Your efforts to open these opportunities to your students, and similar efforts across the country, contribute tremendously to maintaining a strong and capable workforce. We will have no easy resolution to the challenges we face in restoring jobs and strengthening the economy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We also broadly agree with the narrative of the crisis offered in the report, which discusses, among other things, the role of subprime lending in the housing boom and bust; the structural weaknesses in the shadow banking system, including insufficient transparency and investor overreliance on rating agencies; inadequate risk management by many financial institutions; and a flawed regulatory framework that allowed some large financial firms to escape strong consolidated supervision and gave no regulator the mandate or powers needed to effectively evaluate and respond to risks to the financial system as a whole. Among these are the adoption of a more systemic approach to the supervision and regulation of financial firms and markets; enhanced capital and liquidity regulation for financial firms, particularly for systemically important institutions; improved information collection by regulators and, where possible, the public release of such information; development of a resolution regime that would allow the authorities to manage the failure of a systemically important financial firm in an orderly manner while imposing losses on shareholders and creditors; and significant strengthening of the financial infrastructure, particularly for derivatives contracts. And increased public disclosure of such data would provide investors and analysts with a more complete picture of individual firms' strengths and vulnerabilities, as well as of potential risks to the system as a whole, thereby facilitating more effective market discipline. The government instead must have the tools to resolve a failing firm in a manner that preserves market discipline--by ensuring that shareholders and creditors incur losses and that culpable managers are replaced--while at the same time cushioning the broader financial system from the possibly destabilizing effects of the firm's collapse.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The Economic OutlookAfter a precipitous decline in late 2008 and early 2009, the U.S. economy stabilized in the middle of last year and is now expanding at a moderate pace. After two years of job losses, private payrolls expanded at an average of about 100,000 per month during the first half of this year, an improvement but still a pace insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially. Moreover, the municipal bond market has remained reasonably receptive this year to most borrowers, with rates low and new issuance relatively solid, despite the concerns about the fiscal positions of many state and local governments. Because high school graduates have higher earnings, pay more taxes, and are less likely to need to use public health programs, such investments can pay off even from the narrow perspective of state budgets; of course, the returns to the overall economy and to the individuals themselves are much greater.8 Additionally, in a dynamic economy in which job requirements are constantly changing, individuals already in the workforce need opportunities to improve their skills throughout their lives. Estimates of states' unfunded pension liabilities span a wide range, but some researchers put the figure as high as $2 trillion at the end of last year.9 States' unfunded liabilities are significantly higher than before the recession and financial crisis because many pension fund investments have declined in value, and because many states have found it difficult to maintain pension contributions while their budgets are under stress. 10 This daunting problem has no easy solution; in particular, proposals that include modifications of benefits schedules must take into account that accrued pension benefits of state and local workers in many jurisdictions are accorded strong legal protection, including, in some states, constitutional protection.11 In addition to pensions, states will have to address the burgeoning cost of retiree health benefits.\n",

      " A year ago, in my remarks to this conference, I reviewed the response of the global policy community to the financial crisis.1 On the whole, when the eruption of the Panic of 2008 threatened the very foundations of the global economy, the world rose to the challenge, with a remarkable degree of international cooperation, despite very difficult conditions and compressed time frames. This list of concerns makes clear that a return to strong and stable economic growth will require appropriate and effective responses from economic policymakers across a wide spectrum, as well as from leaders in the private sector. Once demand began to stabilize, firms gained sufficient confidence to increase production and slow the rapid liquidation of inventories that they had begun during the contraction. Private-sector employment has grown only sluggishly, the small decline in the unemployment rate is attributable more to reduced labor force participation than to job creation, and initial claims for unemployment insurance remain high. Conceivably, such a step might make sense in a situation in which a prolonged period of deflation had greatly weakened the confidence of the public in the ability of the central bank to achieve price stability, so that drastic measures were required to shift expectations. The combination of increased uncertainty for households and businesses, higher risk premiums in financial markets, and the potential for destabilizing movements in commodity and currency markets would likely overwhelm any benefits arising from this strategy.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The policy response to this challenge has included important successes, most notably the concerted international effort to stabilize the global financial system after the crisis reached its worst point in the fall of 2008. Almost universally, economists failed to predict the nature, timing, or severity of the crisis; and those few who issued early warnings generally identified only isolated weaknesses in the system, not anything approaching the full set of complex linkages and mechanisms that amplified the initial shocks and ultimately resulted in a devastating global crisis and recession. How Economics Helped Us Understand and Respond to the CrisisThe financial crisis represented an enormously complex set of interactions--indeed, a discussion of the triggers that touched off the crisis and the vulnerabilities in the financial system and in financial regulation that allowed the crisis to have such devastating effects could more than fill my time this afternoon.1 The complexity of our financial system, and the resulting difficulty of predicting how developments in one financial market or institution may affect the system as a whole, presented formidable challenges. These failures in turn were partly the result of a regulatory structure that had not adapted adequately to the rise of shadow banking and that placed insufficient emphasis on the detection of systemic risks, as opposed to risks to individual institutions and markets. The best way to achieve such credibility is to create institutional arrangements under which a failure can be allowed to occur without widespread collateral damage; if failures can take place more safely, the authorities will no longer have an incentive to try to avoid them.\n",

      "  Junior Achievement was founded in 1919 and continues to be one of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations dedicated to educating youth in financial literacy, work readiness, and entrepreneurship. It is committed to relevant, hands-on learning for students from kindergarten through high school. It serves 10 million students each year in 121 countries--about 50,000 of them here in the Washington, D.C., area. I applaud Junior Achievement's mission, which is to inspire and prepare young people to succeed in a global economy and cultivate their understanding of the principles of market-based economics and entrepreneurship. We are here today to discover Junior Achievement's Finance Park in Fairfax County. It is the 15th such facility in the United States and will serve 14,000 students annually. The program offers an intensive six-week classroom curriculum, followed by a capstone day at the Finance Park where students participate in a practical personal budgeting simulation. This experiential facility helps students build financial skills that are essential to a successful financial future. Students immerse themselves in reality-based decisionmaking. They practice essential household skills by developing a budget that includes housing, transportation, food, utilities, health care, investments, philanthropy, and banking. The opportunity will enable them to better navigate real-life decisions. I applaud the ongoing partnership among Junior Achievement, schools, and businesses in the greater Washington area. As states and school districts around the country continue to integrate personal finance instruction into their curricula, organizations like Junior Achievement can provide important services to both students and teachers.\n",

      " Through the application of improved policy frameworks, involving both greater transparency and increased independence from short-term political influences, as well as through continued focus and persistence, central banks have largely achieved that goal. In turn, the progress against inflation increased the stability and predictability of the economic environment and thus contributed significantly to improvements in economic performance, not least in many emerging market nations that in previous eras had suffered bouts of very high inflation. In other words, the risks to price stability had become two-sided: With inflation close to levels consistent with price stability, central banks, for the first time in many decades, had to take seriously the possibility that inflation can be too low as well as too high. A second complication for policymaking created by low inflation arises from the fact that low inflation generally implies low nominal interest rates, which increase the potential relevance for policymaking of the zero lower bound on interest rates. Saving rates are up noticeably from pre-crisis levels, and household assets have risen, on net, over recent quarters, while debt and debt service payments have declined markedly relative to income.1 Together with expected further easing in credit terms and conditions offered by lenders, stronger balance sheets should eventually provide households the confidence and the wherewithal to increase their pace of spending. If so, then net job creation may not exceed by much the increase in the size of the labor force, implying that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly.\n",

      "  The economist Alfred Marshall said that economics is the study of people in the ordinary business of life.1 What could be more fundamental? Learning about economics helps students understand how the decisions of millions of people about what to produce and consume determine what Adam Smith called \"the wealth of nations\"--our living standards.2  In particular, economics helps students understand both the strengths and the shortcomings of our market-based economic system. The recent financial crisis was among the most profound challenges to economic and financial stability since the Great Depression, and its causes and its ultimate remedies have been, and will continue to be, widely debated. In retrospect, some of the people who were hurt the most during the crisis borrowed money that they should not have borrowed and signed financial contracts they should not have signed. Today, students need a solid understanding of the benefits and risks of borrowing money to buy a car or a home, and of the effect that too much credit card debt can have on their finances. Besides improving their personal financial decisionmaking, teaching your students economic principles will help them as citizens understand and make choices about many of the critical issues confronting our nation. The Federal Reserve works hard to advance financial literacy and economic education--both through our own programs and by working with other organizations.3  Our financial education website provides easy access to free educational materials, a resource search engine for teachers, and games for students of various ages and knowledge levels.4  Some Reserve Banks offer economic and financial education workshops for teachers, and several Reserve Banks periodically provide lessons in personal finance to middle school and high school students.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But history makes clear that countries that continually spend beyond their means suffer slower growth in incomes and living standards and are prone to greater economic and financial instability. The recent deterioration was largely the result of a sharp decline in tax revenues brought about by the recession and the subsequent slow recovery, as well as by increases in federal spending needed to alleviate the recession and stabilize the financial system. If current policy settings are maintained, and under reasonable assumptions about economic growth, the federal budget will be on an unsustainable path in coming years, with the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income rising at an increasing pace.2 Moreover, as the national debt grows, so will the associated interest payments, which in turn will lead to further increases in projected deficits. Collecting revenues through a more efficient, better-designed tax system could improve economic growth and make achieving sustainable fiscal policies at least somewhat easier. If the economy is strong, for example, the deficit is almost bound to improve, as tax revenues increase and spending on the social safety net decreases; conversely, if the economy weakens, the deficit is likely to rise, notwithstanding prior efforts by the Congress to better manage government spending and taxes. At its best, PAYGO prevents new tax cuts and mandatory spending increases from making projected budget deficits worse; by construction, PAYGO does not require the Congress to reduce the ever-increasing deficits that are already built into current law.\n",

      " We are looking intensively at the firms' policies, procedures, and internal controls related to foreclosures and seeking to determine whether systematic weaknesses are leading to improper foreclosures. High levels of homeownership have been shown to foster greater involvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates, and greater neighborhood stability. Moreover, even in a strong economy, unforeseen life events and risks in local real estate markets make highly leveraged borrowers vulnerable. In time, these practices and products contributed to problems in the broader financial services industry and helped spark a foreclosure crisis marked by a tremendous upheaval in housing markets. Now, more than 20 percent of borrowers owe more than their home is worth and an additional 33 percent have equity cushions of 10 percent or less, putting them at risk should house prices decline much further. With housing markets still weak, high levels of mortgage distress may well persist for some time to come. In response to the fallout from the financial crisis, the Fed has helped stabilize the mortgage market and improve financial conditions more broadly, thus promoting economic recovery. As the foreclosure crisis has intensified, Federal Reserve staff in our research, community development, and supervision and regulation divisions have actively collaborated to support foreclosure prevention at the local level and promote neighborhood stabilization initiatives. They include studies focusing on foreclosure prevention, financial education, and adverse neighborhood effects resulting from foreclosures.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Accordingly, the essential challenge for policymakers around the world is to work together to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome--namely, a robust global economic expansion that is balanced, sustainable, and less prone to crises. And indeed, as figure 4 shows, the U.S. unemployment rate (the solid black line) has stagnated for about eighteen months near 10 percent of the labor force, up from about 5 percent before the crisis; the increase of 5 percentage points in the U.S. unemployment rate is roughly double that seen in the euro area, the United Kingdom, Japan, or Canada. Long-term unemployment not only imposes extreme hardship on jobless people and their families, but, by eroding these workers' skills and weakening their attachment to the labor force, it may also convert what might otherwise be temporary cyclical unemployment into much more intractable long-term structural unemployment. Indeed, although I expect that growth will pick up and unemployment will decline somewhat next year, we cannot rule out the possibility that unemployment might rise further in the near term, creating added risks for the recovery. Because a strong expansion in the emerging market economies will ultimately depend on a recovery in the more advanced economies, this pattern of two-speed growth might very well be resolved in favor of slow growth for everyone if the recovery in the advanced economies falls short. Perhaps most important, the ultimate purpose of economic growth is to deliver higher living standards at home; thus, eventually, the benefits of shifting productive resources to satisfying domestic needs must outweigh the development benefits of continued reliance on export-led growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Financial markets were volatile and illiquid, and the viability of some of the world's leading financial institutions had been called into question. With asset prices falling and the flow of credit to the nonfinancial sector constricted, most of the world's economies had entered what would prove to be a sharp and protracted economic downturn. By the time of that meeting, the world's central banks had already taken significant steps to stabilize financial markets and to mitigate the worst effects of the recession, and they would go on to do much more. Asset purchases seem to have been effective in easing financial conditions; for example, the evidence suggests that such purchases significantly lowered longer-term interest rates in both the United States and the United Kingdom.2 Although the efforts of central banks to stabilize the financial system and provide monetary accommodation helped set the stage for recovery, economic growth rates in the advanced economies have been relatively weak. Although we project that economic growth will pick up and unemployment decline somewhat in the coming year, progress thus far has been disappointingly slow. The first lesson is that, in a world in which the consequences of financial crises can be devastating, fostering financial stability is a critical part of overall macroeconomic management. Accordingly, central banks and other financial regulators must be vigilant in monitoring financial markets and institutions for threats to systemic stability and diligent in taking steps to address such threats. During the crisis, central banks were creative and innovative, developing programs that played a significant role in easing financial stress and supporting economic activity.\n",

      " Nevertheless, overall inflation remains quite low: Over the 12 months ending in December, prices for all the goods and services purchased by households increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.4 percent over the prior 12 months.1 To assess underlying trends in inflation, economists also follow several alternative measures of inflation; one such measure is so-called core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components and therefore can be a better predictor of where overall inflation is headed. Monetary Policy       In sum, although economic growth will probably increase this year, we expect the unemployment rate to remain stubbornly above, and inflation to remain persistently below, the levels that Federal Reserve policymakers have judged to be consistent over the longer term with our mandate from the Congress to foster maximum employment and price stability. For example, under plausible assumptions about how fiscal policies might evolve in the absence of major legislative changes, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects the deficit to fall from around 9 percent of GDP currently to roughly 5 percent of GDP by 2015, but then to rise to about 6‑1/2 percent of GDP by the end of the decade.2 After that, it projects the budget outlook to deteriorate even more rapidly, with federal debt held by the public reaching almost 90 percent of GDP by 2020 and 150 percent of GDP by 2030, up from about 60 percent at the end of fiscal year 2010.\n",

      " My paper for the Banque de France Financial Stability Review extends the basic global saving glut hypothesis to consider the portfolio preferences of foreign investors in the United States and the implications of those preferences.2 Several researchers have argued that capital flows from emerging markets to advanced economies will tend to be directed to the safest and most liquid assets, of which, these researchers argue, there is a relative shortage in emerging markets.3 My paper confirms empirically that the global saving glut countries--principally, some emerging Asian economies and Middle Eastern oil exporters--did indeed evince a strong preference for very safe and liquid U.S. assets in the middle of the past decade, especially Treasury and agency securities. In the case of the United States, sources of poor performance included misaligned incentives in mortgage origination, underwriting, and securitization; risk-management deficiencies among financial institutions; conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies; weaknesses in the capitalization and incentive structures of the government-sponsored enterprises; gaps and weaknesses in the financial regulatory structure; and supervisory failures.4 In reflecting on this experience, I have gained increased appreciation for the challenges faced by policymakers in emerging market economies who have had to manage large and sometimes volatile capital inflows for the past several decades. To achieve a more balanced international system over time, countries with excessive and unsustainable trade surpluses will need to allow their exchange rates to better reflect market fundamentals and increase their efforts to substitute domestic demand for exports.\n",

      " In 1892, on the centennial of the famous Buttonwood Agreement, the New York Stock Exchange took its first steps to improve clearing and settlement by creating a clearinghouse for limited types of brokers' trades.4 Faced with growing volumes of trading and the associated clearing costs after World War I, the New York Stock Exchange took a further step in 1920 by establishing the Stock Clearing Corporation; this new clearinghouse reduced the number of checks needed for settlements by up to 90 percent and the volume of funds and credit needed by 70 percent or more.5 It was not until the dramatic increase in equity trading volumes in the late 1960s, however, that backlogs of trading tickets, confirmations, and delivery instructions caused the infamous \"paperwork crisis\" that led the exchange to curtail trading hours and close on Wednesdays for six months in order to manage the situation.6 The paperwork crisis represented more than a set of operational problems for financial institutions and other market participants. Eighty years later, the 1987 stock market crash provided a marketwide test for securities and derivatives clearinghouses, as well as their members, banks, and related institutions.10 Surging volumes of trades and extraordinary price volatility during the week of October 19th created errors and delays in confirming stock trades, severe operational and financial stress at clearing members, and heavy liquidity demands throughout the financial markets.11 In the derivatives markets, multiple intraday margin calls were made to protect the clearinghouses, but banks sometimes delayed making key payments to and from the clearinghouses, adding to the uncertainty.\n",

      " In subsequent years, my remarks touched on the need to strengthen regulation and supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, approaches to reducing preventable mortgage foreclosures, community banking and the financial crisis, and then last year, the need to address the problem of financial institutions that are \"too big to fail.\" The recent financial crisis highlighted the fact that some financial firms had grown so large, leveraged, and interconnected that their failure could pose a threat to overall financial stability. This competitive distortion is not only unfair to smaller firms and damaging to competition today, but it also spurs further growth by the largest firms and more consolidation and concentration in the financial industry. Our goal is to produce a well-integrated set of rules that meaningfully reduces the probability of failure of our largest, most complex financial firms and that minimizes the losses to the financial system and the economy if such a firm should fail. Instead, we need the tools to resolve a failing firm in a manner that preserves market discipline--by ensuring that shareholders and creditors incur losses and that culpable managers are replaced--and that at the same time cushions the broader financial system from the possibly destabilizing effects of the firm's collapse. In short, two key objectives of financial regulatory reform are, first, addressing the problems that emerged in the largest, most complex financial firms during the crisis and, second, creating a better balance with respect to regulation and oversight between banks and nonbank financial firms.\n",

      " Estimates of state and local governments' unfunded pension liabilities for the nation as a whole span a wide range, with some researchers putting the figure in the neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion.2 Some governments are beginning to take difficult steps to address this problem, although their ability to change plan provisions is limited by the strong legal protection (including, in some states, constitutional protection) accorded to accrued pension benefits of public employees in many jurisdictions.3 State and local governments also will have to address the burgeoning costs of retiree health benefits. As the past couple of years have shown, the balanced-budget rules under which most states operate can force sharp cuts in services and increases in taxes during recessions, which is just the time when many people in the state are economically most vulnerable. One reason for this greater sensitivity is that capital income, which tends to vary substantially more than wage and salary income, has become an increasingly important source of state personal income taxes.6 Also, sales taxes may have become more cyclical because of an increasing tendency to exempt certain necessities, for which demand is relatively more stable. The payoffs of early childhood programs can be especially high.7 For instance, preschool programs for disadvantaged children have been shown to increase high school graduation rates.8 Because high school graduates have higher earnings, pay more taxes, and are less likely to use public health programs, investing in such programs can pay off even from the narrow perspective of state budgets; of course, the returns to the overall economy and to the individuals themselves are much greater.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The foreclosure rate remains very high, and many homeowners who have avoided foreclosure find themselves \"under water,\" meaning their mortgage debt exceeds the value of their homes. In some areas, for example, high foreclosure rates have produced significant numbers of vacant properties, depressing surrounding home prices, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for local governments. People who were vulnerable to begin with--those with low incomes, few assets, and less education--have had a more difficult time weathering the financial storm or recovering from setbacks. One of the most valuable sources of data on family finances is the Federal Reserve Board's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances.2  To better understand the effects of the crisis on households, the Board, in a special update to its 2007 survey, asked the participants about their financial and personal circumstances two years later, in 2009.3 The findings help illustrate the challenges facing families and communities. Those areas already lacked sufficient assets such as strong public schools and community facilities, and rising unemployment and falling tax revenues reduced the funds available for public services even as needs increased. When so many social and economic problems are interconnected--high unemployment, foreclosures, crime, loss of tax revenues and social services, lack of economic opportunity--deciding where to start to improve the situation can be quite difficult. As the crisis continues to play out, community leaders have found ways to reuse vacant land, adding gardens, yard expansions, and bike trails among the neighborhood's declining number of homes, making it safer and more attractive. Until vulnerable families and troubled communities have regained lost progress, the economic recovery will remain incomplete.\n",

      " The oversight of individual institutions serves many purposes beyond the enhancement of systemic stability, including the protection of the deposit insurance fund, the detection of money laundering and other forms of financial crime, and the prevention of unlawful discrimination or abusive lending practices. If short-term funding were suddenly to become unavailable, how would the borrowing firms react--for example, would they be forced into a fire sale of assets, which itself could be destabilizing, or would they cease to provide funding or critical services for other financial actors? Understandably, given the damage wrought by the crisis, the council and its members remain focused on addressing possible sources of financial instability, including both structural problems and risks arising from ongoing economic or financial developments. However, no one's interests are served by the imposition of ineffective or burdensome rules that lead to excessive increases in costs or unnecessary restrictions in the supply of credit. Increased coordination and cooperation among regulators, under the auspices of the council where appropriate, should serve not only to improve our management of systemic risk, but also reduce the extent of duplicative, inconsistent, or ineffective rulemakings. Consistent with the macroprudential approach, the Basel III framework requires the largest, most globally active banks to hold more, higher-quality capital, reflecting the greater systemic risk associated with financial distress at the largest institutions. While a great deal has been accomplished since the act was passed less than a year ago, much work remains to better understand sources of systemic risk, to develop improved monitoring tools, and to evaluate and implement policy instruments to reduce macroprudential risks.\n",

      " Nonetheless, if output per person increases more rapidly, the prospects for greater and more broad-based prosperity are significantly enhanced. If many people are able to exploit, or otherwise benefit from, research done by others, then the total or social return to research may be higher on average than the private return to those who bear the costs and risks of innovation. A cutting-edge scientific or technological center can create a variety of spillovers that promote innovation, quality, skills acquisition, and productivity in industries located nearby; such spillovers are the reason that high-tech firms often locate in clusters or near leading universities.13  To the extent that countries gain from leadership in technologically vibrant industries or from local spillovers arising from inventive activity, the case for government support of R&D within a given country is stronger.14 How Should Governments Provide Support for Research and Development? Supporting multiple approaches to a given problem at the same time increases the chance of finding a solution; it also increases opportunities for cooperation or constructive competition.17  The challenge to policymakers is to encourage experimentation and a greater diversity of approaches while simultaneously ensuring that an effective peer-review process is in place to guide funding toward high-quality science.18 However it is channeled, government support for innovation and R&D will be more effective if it is thought of as a long-run investment. And, contrary to the notion that highly trained and talented immigrants displace native-born workers in the labor market, scientists and other highly trained professionals who come to the United States tend to enhance the productivity and employment opportunities of those already here, reflecting gains from interaction and cooperation and from the development of critical masses of researchers in technical areas.\n",

      " I am very pleased to join the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce at this gala dinner as its members look back on another year of working to build the mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship between our two countries. Thus, I am especially honored to join Agustín Carstens, the distinguished governor of the Bank of Mexico, in receiving your Good Neighbor Award. I have benefited from many years of contact and shared experiences with Agustín and his colleagues at the central bank of Mexico. Some years ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Bank of Mexico. But I must confess that I enjoyed the trip as much for the cultural excursions as for the economics. In late 2006, not long after I became Chairman, he became finance minister of Mexico, and last year he succeeded Guillermo Ortiz as governor of the Bank of Mexico. We have had many opportunities to meet and share views about the U.S., Mexican, and global economies. My appreciation for his wisdom and insight as an economist and policymaker has grown with each encounter. Our productive and, I hope, mutually beneficial relationship reflects the close relationship of the United States and Mexico. It has tamed the rampant inflation that prevailed before the 1990s, placed its budget on a sounder footing, and avoided the repeated financial crises to which it was once prone. Because the prosperity of our countries is so closely linked, we in the United States benefit from their foresight and hard work.\n",

      " At the same time, establishing a credible plan for reducing future deficits now would not only enhance economic performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence. So far at least, there is not much evidence that inflation is becoming broad-based or ingrained in our economy; indeed, increases in the price of a single product--gasoline--account for the bulk of the recent increase in consumer price inflation.1 Of course, gasoline prices are exceptionally important for both family finances and the broader economy; but the fact that gasoline price increases alone account for so much of the overall increase in inflation suggests that developments in the global market for crude oil and related products, as well as in other commodities markets, are the principal factors behind the recent movements in inflation, rather than factors specific to the U.S. economy. To be clear, I am not arguing that healthy increases in real wages are inconsistent with low inflation; the two are perfectly consistent so long as productivity growth is reasonably strong. Slow growth in the United States and a persistent trade deficit are additional, more fundamental sources of recent declines in the dollar's value; in particular, as the United States is a major oil importer, any geopolitical or other shock that increases the global price of oil will worsen our trade balance and economic outlook, which tends to depress the dollar. In either case, if such forces were driving commodity prices materially and persistently higher, we should see corresponding increases in commodity inventories, as higher prices curtailed consumption and boosted production relative to their fundamental levels. In fact, inventories of most commodities have not shown sizable increases over the past year as prices rose; indeed, increases in prices have often been associated with lower rather than higher levels of inventories, likely reflecting strong demand or weak supply that tends to put pressure on available stocks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " At the same time, acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits would not only enhance economic performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence. In addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, we should reform the government's tax policies and spending priorities so that they not only reduce the deficit, but also enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by increasing incentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our workforce, by stimulating private capital formation, by promoting research and development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure. In particular, even a short suspension of payments on principal or interest on the Treasury's debt obligations could cause severe disruptions in financial markets and the payments system, induce ratings downgrades of U.S. government debt, create fundamental doubts about the creditworthiness of the United States, and damage the special role of the dollar and Treasury securities in global markets in the longer term. Interest rates would likely rise, slowing the recovery and, perversely, worsening the deficit problem by increasing required interest payments on the debt for what might well be a protracted period.3 Some have suggested that payments by the Treasury could be prioritized to meet principal and interest payments on debt outstanding, thus avoiding a technical default on federal debt.\n",

      " In particular, the financial crisis and the subsequent slow recovery have caused some to question whether the United States, notwithstanding its long-term record of vigorous economic growth, might not now be facing a prolonged period of stagnation, regardless of its public policy choices. Importantly, structural reform is moving forward in the financial sector, with ambitious domestic and international efforts underway to enhance the capital and liquidity of banks, especially the most systemically important banks; to improve risk management and transparency; to strengthen market infrastructure; and to introduce a more systemic, or macroprudential, approach to financial regulation and supervision. From the latest comprehensive revisions to the national accounts as well as the most recent estimates of growth in the first half of this year, we have learned that the recession was even deeper and the recovery even weaker than we had thought; indeed, aggregate output in the United States still has not returned to the level that it attained before the crisis. Importantly, economic growth has for the most part been at rates insufficient to achieve sustained reductions in unemployment, which has recently been fluctuating a bit above 9 percent. Notably, the housing sector has been a significant driver of recovery from most recessions in the United States since World War II, but this time--with an overhang of distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for builders and potential homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about continued house price declines--the rate of new home construction has remained at less than one-third of its pre-crisis level. Low and stable inflation improves the functioning of markets, making them more effective at allocating resources; and it allows households and businesses to plan for the future without having to be unduly concerned with unpredictable movements in the general level of prices.\n",

      "  Distinguished guests, I would like to welcome you to this conference on the \"Regulation of Systemic Risk,\" which is jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking. 1 It is the fourth conference in a series that was initiated in 2005 and is held every two years. These conferences support original research on topics that are highly relevant for the Federal Reserve's public policy mission. While the previous three conferences focused on monetary policy issues, the papers presented at this conference relate to the Federal Reserve's duty to maintain financial stability and contain systemic risk. The recent financial crisis has spurred a great deal of research on its causes and, more broadly, on the topic of systemic risk and its regulation. This research is of critical importance. It can inform the design and implementation of macroprudential regulations and policies, and I suspect no one in this audience needs to be convinced that we must get this right. Two focus on an important aspect of the recent financial crisis--namely, the rise and fall of mortgage securitization and associated swings in real estate lending.2 Other papers study the causes and indicators of systemic risk more generally and look at how well macroprudential regulations and policies can address those causes.3 Finally, several papers examine specific regulations from a macroprudential perspective, including capital requirements and risk retention rules for securitization.4 3.\n",

      " Importantly, economic growth over the past two years has, for the most part, been at rates insufficient to achieve sustained reductions in the unemployment rate, which has recently been fluctuating a bit above 9 percent. But households are struggling with other important headwinds as well, including the persistently high level of unemployment, slow gains in wages for those who remain employed, falling house prices, and debt burdens that remain high for many, notwithstanding that households, in the aggregate, have been saving more and borrowing less. Notably, the housing sector has been a significant driver of recovery from most recessions in the United States since World War II, but this time--with an overhang of distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for builders and potential homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about continued house price declines--the rate of new home construction has remained at less than one-third of its pre-crisis peak. This drag has become particularly evident in recent months, as bouts of sharp volatility and risk aversion in markets have reemerged in reaction to concerns about European sovereign debts and related strains as well as developments associated with the U.S. fiscal situation, including last month's downgrade of the U.S. long-term credit rating by one of the major ratings agencies and the recent controversy surrounding the raising of the U.S. federal debt ceiling. It is difficult to judge how much these events and the associated financial volatility have affected economic activity thus far, but there seems little doubt that they have hurt household and business confidence, and that they pose ongoing risks to growth.\n",

      " Williamson's original list of recommendations can usefully be divided into three categories: first, steps to increase macroeconomic stability, such as reducing fiscal deficits (which had caused high inflation in many countries), broadening the tax base, and reallocating government resources to build human and physical capital; second, actions to increase the role of markets in the economy, such as privatization of public assets, appropriate deregulation, and the liberalization of trade, interest rates, and capital flows; and third, efforts to strengthen institutions that promote investment, business formation, and growth, particularly by enhancing property rights and the rule of law. On the other hand, some critics fault the Washington Consensus for paying insufficient attention to the role in economic growth of a much broader range of institutional factors than property rights alone--stand ardized accounting conventions, political accountability, control of corruption, bankruptcy laws, and capable and transparent regulatory agencies, for example.9 Moreover, the Washington Consensus provided little specific advice on how to create and sustain a strong institutional framework, nor did it touch on a variety of institutional arrangements‑‑central bank independence being one familiar example--that have been shown to promote economic stability and growth.10 Amending the Washington Consensus       Overall, some key elements of the Washington Consensus appear well supported both by basic economic logic and by their successful application by a number of countries. Even with continued strong policies, their growth will slow as returns to capital investments diminish and the most profitable opportunities are exploited.\n",

      "  The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, together with the associated deep recession, was a historic event--historic in the sense that its severity and economic consequences were enormous, but also in the sense that, as the papers at this conference document, the crisis seems certain to have profound and long-lasting effects on our economy, our society, and our politics. For example, since financial excesses tend to develop over a relatively longer time frame and can have significant effects on inflation when they ultimately unwind, it has been suggested that monetary policy should be conducted with reference to a longer horizon to take appropriate account of financial stability concerns.2 My guess is that the current framework for monetary policy--with innovations, no doubt, to further improve the ability of central banks to communicate with the public--will remain the standard approach, as its benefits in terms of macroeconomic stabilization have been demonstrated. In my view, the issue is not whether central bankers should ignore possible financial imbalances--they should not--but, rather, what \"the right tool for the job\" is to respond to such imbalances.8 The evolving consensus, which is by no means settled, is that monetary policy is too blunt a tool to be routinely used to address possible financial imbalances; instead, monetary policy should remain focused on macroeconomic objectives, while more-targeted microprudential and macroprudential tools should be used to address developing risks to financial stability, such as excessive credit growth.\n",

      " The ultimate goal of this meeting is to learn more about how best to support both small businesses and their communities--to understand what works and what doesn't. They have faced weak sales, diminished asset values, elevated uncertainty, and tight credit market conditions. We need to think carefully about how, in the current economic environment, our nation can best provide small businesses and entrepreneurs with the support they need to expand job opportunities. Small businesses also help our country compete globally; they often offer a level of agility in bringing innovative products to the global marketplace that larger firms cannot match. At home, many entrepreneurs do more than provide important goods and services--they and their businesses help sustain the vitality of the neighborhoods in which they live and work. For many people, starting a small business is an opportunity to follow one's particular dream. We should recognize that it can also be an important option for people confronting economic challenges in their lives, such as insufficient retirement savings. We do that, for example, through research that adds to our stock of knowledge about the catalysts for and barriers to entrepreneurship, and through outreach programs to help small business owners and other community stakeholders gain access to a range of financing and technical assistance. For instance, in a recent forum sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and held in Jacksonville, Florida, both small business owners and their lenders stressed that it takes more than an enterprising spirit to succeed; entrepreneurs also must seek appropriate training and resources.\n",

      " In 2008 and early 2009, the world suffered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis which, had it been left unchecked, would have resulted in a global financial meltdown and an economic collapse. The unemployment rate remains painfully high, and more than two-fifths of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than six months, by far the highest ratio since World War II. That rate is low enough that people and businesses can make financial decisions without having to worry too much about rising costs, but high enough to keep the economy away from deflation--falling wages and prices--which is both a cause and a symptom of an extremely weak economy. That high unemployment rate is why the Federal Reserve is focusing its monetary policy at strengthening the recovery and job creation, including keeping short-term interest rates near zero and longer-term rates, such as mortgage rates, at the lowest levels in decades. We're working with the other agencies to significantly increase the financial reserves that banks--especially the largest banks that can put the financial system at risk--must hold against possible losses. We are also collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to implement new rules that will make it easier for the government to unwind big financial firms if they get into trouble, rather than being faced with the terrible choice of either bailing them out or risking the collapse of the financial system if they fail. The law's purpose is to allow servicemembers to perform their duties without worry of foreclosure, eviction, and civil prosecution--under most circumstances.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, studies suggest that unemployed people suffer from a higher incidence of stress‐related health problems such as depression, stroke, and heart disease, and they may have a lower life expectancy.4   The children of the unemployed achieve less in school and appear to have reduced long-term earnings prospects.5 In addition, unemployment--especially long-term unemployment--imposes important economic costs on everyone, not just the unemployed themselves. In the shorter term, because the process of matching the long-term unemployed to jobs typically takes more time, the currently high level of long-term unemployment might in itself be a reason that further progress in reducing the unemployment rate, and thus in achieving a more complete recovery, could be slow.6 A pessimistic view is that a large share of the unemployment we are seeing, particularly the longer-term unemployment, is structural in nature, reflecting factors such as inadequate skills or mismatches between the types of skills that workers have and the skills that employers demand. To the extent that higher rates of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, result from structural factors, the scope for countercyclical policies to reduce unemployment would be impaired, and the benefits of a more complete economic recovery for many workers who are unemployed or discouraged would be more limited. Even if the primary cause of high long-term unemployment is insufficient aggregate demand, if progress in reducing unemployment is too slow, the long-term unemployed will see their skills and labor force attachment atrophy further, possibly converting a cyclical problem into a structural one.\n",

      " I have very much enjoyed attending these annual ICBA get-togethers, especially since I get the chance to hear directly from you about what's happening in your local economies and in community banking more generally. They help keep their local economies vibrant and growing by taking on and managing the risks of local lending, which larger banks may be unwilling or unable to do. Their close ties to local economies are, on balance, a source of strength, but a drawback of those ties is that the fortunes of communities and their banks tend to rise and fall together. Another concern for community banks is the narrowing of the range of their profitable lending activities: Because larger banks have used their scale to gain a pricing advantage in volume-driven businesses such as consumer lending, community banks have tended to specialize in other areas, such as loans secured by commercial real estate. Despite some recent signs of improvement, the recovery has been frustratingly slow, constraining opportunities for profitable lending. To protect banks from new problems down the road, and to safeguard the Deposit Insurance Fund, supervisors must insist on high standards for lending, risk management, and governance. It is important to emphasize that the Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act largely in response to the \"too big to fail\" problem, and that most of its provisions--regarding, for example, capital, liquidity, and risk management--apply only, or principally, to the largest, most complex, and internationally active banks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Accordingly, risks at community banks tend to arise from their lending, in the form of credit risk, interest rate risk, or concentration risk, rather than from the trading, market-making, and investment banking activities associated with the largest banks. However, by taking on and managing the risks of local lending, which larger banks may be unwilling or unable to do, community banks help keep their local economies vibrant and growing. Despite some recent signs of improvement, the recovery has been frustratingly slow, constraining opportunities for profitable lending. Although the ratios of nonperforming assets remain high in many cases, asset quality appears to be stabilizing, and bank provisions for loan losses are decreasing. Let me take this opportunity to mention one concern that is of particular relevance to the Federal Reserve: A common complaint on the part of some community bankers is that very low interest rates hurt their profitability by squeezing net interest margins. The purpose of the Federal Reserve's policy of low interest rates is to speed the economic recovery, which will increase loan demand and opportunities for profitable lending, among many other benefits, and thus, ultimately, lead to higher net interest margins. Moreover, the benefits of a stronger economy for the performance of existing assets should also be taken into account; as you know, delinquencies decline as the economy improves. Research by economists throughout the Federal Reserve System is another means of gaining a better understanding not only about current conditions in community banking, but also about the more fundamental forces that drive their profitability and lending.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " An important example of our strengthened, cross-firm supervisory approach is the recently completed second annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).1 In the CCAR, the Federal Reserve assessed the internal capital planning processes of the 19 largest bank holding companies and evaluated their capital adequacy under a very severe hypothetical stress scenario that included a peak unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50 percent drop in equity prices, and a further 21 percent decline in housing prices. We have also been analyzing scenarios under which European sovereign debt developments might lead to broader dislocations, for example, through a sharp increase in investor risk aversion that adversely affects asset values. This work not only has improved our understanding of banks' individual risk profiles, it also has helped us better evaluate the potential effects of financial disruptions in Europe on credit flows and economic activity in the United States. Notwithstanding the new regulations, the risk of runs created by a combination of fixed net asset values, extremely risk-averse investors, and the absence of explicit loss absorption capacity remains a concern, particularly since some of the tools that policymakers employed to stem the runs during the crisis are no longer available. But even as we make progress on known vulnerabilities, we must be mindful that our financial system is constantly evolving, and that unanticipated risks to stability will develop over time. In the aftermath of the crisis, however, financial stability policy has taken on greater prominence and is now generally considered to stand on an equal footing with monetary policy as a critical responsibility of central banks.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Needless to say, the events of the past few years pose serious challenges to the conventional, pre-crisis views and approaches of central banks and other financial supervisors. The crisis, the recession it sparked, and the subsequent slow recovery, especially in the advanced economies, have demonstrated that we have much to learn about the workings and vulnerabilities of our modern, globalized financial system and its interactions with the broader economy. In responding to these stressful financial and economic developments, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have had to deploy a variety of new tools and approaches to carry out their responsibilities regarding monetary policy and the provision of liquidity, tools about which we still have more to learn. Finally, in the wake of the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies have been charged with challenging new responsibilities in the area of macroprudential supervision, with the objective of promoting financial stability and reducing the likelihood and the costs of a future financial crisis. Although much progress has been made, we are still at an early stage in understanding how best to meet these new macroprudential responsibilities. This outpouring of research will help shape future central bank doctrine and policy approaches and, most importantly, should help central banks better carry out their mission to promote the public welfare. Two contributions consider the implications of recent events for the conduct of monetary policy, both conventional and unconventional.2 Another paper addresses the relationship between monetary aggregates and financial stability.3 And several papers investigate issues in the field of regulation and macroprudential supervision, including the design of an integrated framework for regulation, a proposal for dealing with systemically important resolution issues in the repurchase agreement markets, and a review of the progress to date in reengineering the financial system.4 4.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In the private sector, some key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage; excessive dependence on unstable short-term funding; deficiencies in risk management in major financial firms; and the use of exotic and nontransparent financial instruments that obscured concentrations of risk. First, much of the decline in house prices has occurred since the most intense phase of the crisis; the decline in prices since September 2008 is probably better viewed as largely the result of, rather than a cause of, the crisis and ensuing recession. More fundamentally, however, any theory of the crisis that ties its magnitude to the size of the housing bust must also explain why the fall of dot-com stock prices just a few years earlier, which destroyed as much or more paper wealth--more than $8 trillion--resulted in a relatively short and mild recession and no major financial instability.2 Once again, the explanation of the differences between the two episodes must be that the problems in housing and mortgage markets interacted with deeper vulnerabilities in the financial system in ways that the dot-com bust did not. Beginning in 2007, declining house prices and rising rates of foreclosure raised serious concerns about the values of mortgage-related assets and considerable uncertainty about where those losses would fall. The Federal Reserve's responses to the failure or near failure of a number of systemically critical firms reflected the best of bad options, given the absence of a legal framework for winding down such firms in an orderly way in the midst of a crisis--a framework that we now have.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The hypothetical supervisory stress scenario used in the CCAR was quite severe; it included a peak unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50 percent drop in equity prices, and a 21 percent further decline in housing prices, as well as steep falls in prices of financial assets most exposed to conditions in Europe. In addition, while standard measures of community banks' profitability, such as return on equity and assets, improved last year, as was also true at larger institutions, most of the gains were due to reductions in loan loss provisions rather than to more sustainable sources of profit such as expanded lending. Bank credit default swap (CDS) premiums are now well below their crisis peaks, and bank stock prices have retraced some of their earlier losses and have outperformed the broader market this year, boosted somewhat by the release of the CCAR results in March and first-quarter earnings that largely beat analysts' expectations. Such measures include the conditional value at risk, or CoVaR, which is an estimate of the extent to which a bank's distress would be associated with an increase in the downside risk to the financial system; the distress insurance premium, or DIP, which measures the cost of insuring a firm against systemwide distress; and the systemic expected shortfall, or SES, which estimates the extent to which the market value equity of a firm would be depleted by a marketwide decline in equity prices.\n",

      " When individuals are denied opportunities to reach their maximum potential, it harms not only those individuals, of course, but also the larger economy, which depends vitally on having a skilled, productive workforce. The research shows that effective educations lead to lower rates of poverty, higher lifetime earnings, and greater satisfaction on the job and at home. Programs that provide enriched experiences for children and that also involve parents have shown to benefit children from all backgrounds, but they have the strongest influence on children from disadvantaged environments.2 Importantly, state preschool assessments have shown that early childhood education programs make children better prepared for school, a precursor of future success.3 The benefits of early childhood programs are not just short-term in nature. For example, analysis of one program showed that children who attended a high-quality half-day preschool program at ages 3 and 4 were, at age 40, more economically successful--for example, more likely to own their own homes--than nonparticipants in a control group.4 In other evaluations, long-term benefits were demonstrated for a full-day early childhood education program starting before age 1 and for a nurse-based home visiting program.5 Economically speaking, early childhood programs are a good investment, with inflation-adjusted annual rates of return on the funds dedicated to these programs estimated to reach 10 percent or higher.6 Very few alternative investments can promise that kind of return. Notably, a portion of these economic returns accrues to the children themselves and their families, but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority of the benefits, reflecting the many contributions that skilled and productive workers make to the economy.7 The Federal Reserve has long supported increasing educational opportunity for children, including the youngest.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Indeed, the experience of the recent financial crisis and the ensuing recession was strongly reflected in nearly all of these aggregate measures, indicating the severe economic stress felt by millions of people and hundreds of communities across the country. Indeed, an interesting finding in the literature is that the overwhelming majority of people in the United States and in many other countries report being very happy or pretty happy on a daily basis‑‑a finding that researchers link to people's intrinsic abilities to adapt and find satisfaction in their lives even in very difficult circumstances.3 This line of research has generated alternative measures of well-being that are frequently survey-based and incorporate elements such as psychological wellness, the level of education, physical health and safety, community vitality and the strength of family and social ties, and time spent in leisure activities. One topic on the frontier of economics and psychology is the neurological basis of human decisions, including decisionmaking under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social decisionmaking.5   Researchers are investigating behavioral tendencies in a variety of circumstances--for instance, by examining human responses to perceived inequality, losses, risk, and uncertainty; the need for autonomy; and the importance for well-being of social ties and community. For example, brain imaging research has documented differences in the brain regions that light up in response to losses and gains‑‑a clear physical manifestation of the \"loss aversion\" documented in the earlier behavioral studies in economics and psychology.6   Evolutionary psychologists suggest that humans experienced evolutionary benefits from brain developments that included aversion to loss and risk, and from instincts for cooperation that helped strengthen communities.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak today with educators throughout the country on the topic of financial education. Today I hope you will learn from each other and share ways to best promote learning and, in particular, to help students achieve greater financial literacy. As the recent financial crisis illustrates, consumers who can make informed decisions about financial products and services not only serve their own best interests, but, collectively, they also help promote broader economic stability. Smart financial planning--such as budgeting, saving for emergencies, and preparing for retirement--can help households enjoy better lives while weathering financial shocks. Research by Federal Reserve Board staff members on the effectiveness of financial education for young military personnel, for instance, found that those who had taken a high school financial education course were more likely to save regularly.1 Effective financial education is not just about teaching students about financial products or performing financial calculations. However, if they understand and remember some basic ideas--for instance, that it's important to shop around for a loan to get the lowest interest rate, to review the fees charged, and to know how to contact financial counselors and advisers--they will be more likely to make a good decision. Given the ubiquity of smartphones, applications for mobile devices may be one effective method of delivering this just-in-time information at a relatively low cost.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The key premise underlying this channel is that, for a variety of reasons, different classes of financial assets are not perfect substitutes in investors' portfolios.4 For example, some institutional investors face regulatory restrictions on the types of securities they can hold, retail investors may be reluctant to hold certain types of assets because of high transactions or information costs, and some assets have risk characteristics that are difficult or costly to hedge. In November, the FOMC announced a program to purchase a total of $600 billion in agency MBS and agency debt.6 In March 2009, the FOMC expanded this purchase program substantially, announcing that it would purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS, up to $200 billion of agency debt, and up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury debt.7 These purchases were completed, with minor adjustments, in early 2010.8 In November 2010, the FOMC announced that it would further expand the Federal Reserve's security holdings by purchasing an additional $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over a period ending in mid-2011.9 About a year ago, the FOMC introduced a variation on its earlier purchase programs, known as the maturity extension program (MEP), under which the Federal Reserve would purchase $400 billion of long-term Treasury securities and sell an equivalent amount of shorter-term Treasury securities over the period ending in June 2012.10 The FOMC subsequently extended the MEP through the end of this year.11 By reducing the average maturity of the securities held by the public, the MEP puts additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and further eases overall financial conditions. These considerations include the need to take out insurance against the realization of downside risks, which are particularly difficult to manage when rates are close to their effective lower bound; the possibility that, because of various unusual headwinds slowing the recovery, the economy needs more policy support than usual at this stage of the cycle; and the need to compensate for limits to policy accommodation resulting from the lower bound on rates.24 Has the forward guidance been effective? I have noted on other occasions that the declines in unemployment we have seen would likely continue only if economic growth picked up to a rate above its longer-term trend.28 In fact, growth in recent quarters has been tepid, and so, not surprisingly, we have seen no net improvement in the unemployment rate since January.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " So, for that player, for club members and guests here today, and for anyone else curious about the Federal Reserve and monetary policy, I will ask and answer these five questions: As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve is charged with promoting a healthy economy--broadly speaking, an economy with low unemployment, low and stable inflation, and a financial system that meets the economy's needs for credit and other services and that is not itself a source of instability. In normal circumstances, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy through its influence on short-term interest rates, which in turn affect other interest rates and asset prices.1 Generally, if economic weakness is the primary concern, the Fed acts to reduce interest rates, which supports the economy by inducing businesses to invest more in new capital goods and by leading households to spend more on houses, autos, and other goods and services. Though the economy has been growing since mid-2009 and we expect it to continue to expand, it simply has not been growing fast enough recently to make significant progress in bringing down unemployment. So the odds are high that the purchase programs that the Fed has undertaken in support of the recovery will end up reducing, not increasing, the federal debt, both through the interest earnings we send the Treasury and because a stronger economy tends to lead to higher tax revenues and reduced government spending (on unemployment benefits, for example).\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Accordingly, the pace of economic growth has been insufficient to support significant improvement in the job market; indeed, the unemployment rate, at 7.8 percent, is well above what we judge to be its long-run normal level. And in the emerging market economies, the rapid snap-back from the global financial crisis has given way to slower growth in the face of weak export demand from the advanced economies. The Committee also judged that there were significant downside risks to this outlook, importantly including the potential for an intensification of strains in Europe and an associated slowing in global growth. In January, the Committee noted that it anticipated that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014--a year and a half later than in previous statements. The open-ended nature of these new asset purchases, together with their explicit conditioning on improvements in labor market conditions, will provide the Committee with flexibility in responding to economic developments and instill greater public confidence that the Federal Reserve will take the actions necessary to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. An easing in financial conditions and greater public confidence should help promote more rapid economic growth and faster job gains over coming quarters. The rebound in emerging market economies from the global financial crisis, even as the advanced economies remained weak, provided still greater encouragement to these flows. The resultant rebalancing from external to domestic demand would not only preserve near-term growth in the emerging market economies while supporting recovery in the advanced economies, it would redound to everyone's benefit in the long run by putting the global economy on a more stable and sustainable path.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " We also know that the burdens of a weak economy and the benefits of economic growth often are not equally shared, and that, to be truly effective, policymakers must take into account how their decisions affect the least advantaged, not just the economy as a whole. Developments in Housing and Housing Finance       The multiyear boom and bust in housing prices of the past decade, together with the sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and defaults that followed, were among the principal causes of the financial crisis and the ensuing deep recession--a recession that cost some 8 million jobs. For example, among all income groups, between 2007 and 2010, homeownership rates fell the most for households with income of $20,000 or less, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.4 Data from the Census Bureau show that, over the period from 2004 to 2012, the homeownership rate fell about 5 percentage points for African Americans, compared with about 2 percentage points for other groups.5 Homeownership rates fall when existing homeowners lose or leave their properties, when barriers to homeownership increase, or both. Buying a home usually means obtaining a mortgage, and the data show that the pace of mortgage lending has fallen considerably on a national basis; the extension of first-lien mortgages to purchase homes fell by more than half from 2006 to 2011 and now stands at the lowest level since 1995.6 Again, the contraction in mortgage originations has been particularly severe for minority groups and those with lower incomes: Since the peak in mortgage lending in 2006, the number of home-purchase loans extended to African Americans and Hispanics has fallen more than 65 percent, whereas lending to non-Hispanic whites has fallen less than 50 percent.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " This decline is obviously welcome, but it has taken a long time to achieve that progress, and the unemployment rate is still well above both its level prior to the onset of the recession and the level that my colleagues and I think can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved. So the fact that unemployment has declined in recent years despite economic growth at about 2 percent suggests that the growth rate of potential output must have recently been lower than the roughly 2-1/2 percent rate that appeared to be in place before the crisis.3 There are a number of ways in which the financial crisis could have slowed the rate of growth of the economy's potential. The pace of productivity gains‑‑another key determinant of growth in potential output--may also have been restrained by the crisis, as business investment declined sharply during the recession; and increases in risk aversion and uncertainty, together with tight credit conditions, may have impeded the commercial application of new technologies and slowed the pace of business formation. Likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant problem, we would expect to see wage pressures developing in those regions and industries where labor demand is strong; in fact, wage gains have been quite subdued in most industries and parts of the country.4 Indeed, as I indicated earlier, the consensus among my colleagues on the FOMC is that the unemployment rate is still well above its longer-run sustainable level, perhaps by 2 to 2-1/2 percentage points or so.5 A critical question, then, is why significant slack in the job market remains three years after the recovery began.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As shown in chart 2, the expected average of the short-term real rate over the next 10 years has gradually declined to near zero over the past few years, in part reflecting downward revisions in expectations about the pace of the ongoing recovery and, hence, a pushing out of expectations regarding how long nominal short-term rates will remain low.4 As the persistence of the effects of the crisis have become clearer, the Federal Reserve's communications have reinforced the expectation that conditions are likely to warrant highly accommodative policy for some time: Most recently, the FOMC indicated that it expects to maintain an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, projected inflation between one and two years ahead is no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent target, and long-term inflation expectations remain stable.5 In discussing the role of monetary policy in determining the expected future path of real short-term rates, I have cheated a little: What monetary policy actually controls is nominal short-term rates. Of course, the two risks may very well be mutually reinforcing: Taking on duration risk is one way investors may reach for yield, and the losses resulting from a sharp rise in longer-term rates will be greater if investors have done so.15 One might argue that the right response to these risks is to tighten monetary policy, raising long-term interest rates with the aim of forestalling any undesirable buildup of risk.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Because I have developed these themes in some detail elsewhere, I thought today I would tackle a different and more recent issue that has arisen in the aftermath of the crisis--the issue of whether, in the widespread easing of monetary policies, we are seeing a competitive depreciation of exchange rates.2  Like other aspects of the crisis, the notion of competitive depreciation has strong classical antecedents, particularly in relation to the global Great Depression of the 1930s. Notably, as John Maynard Keynes pointed out in his famous pamphlet, The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill, the British pound was overvalued under the new gold standard, which disadvantaged British exports and contributed to weak economic conditions in the United Kingdom in the late 1920s.3  One of Mervyn King's predecessors as governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, who presided over both Britain's return to the gold standard and its subsequent exit, said of the ill-fated choice of parity for the pound: \"Only God could tell whether it [the value in gold chosen for the pound sterling] was or was not the correct figure\"; another commentator added, \"But of course the Deity may not be an Economist. \"4 Another problem, which became clear as the global economy weakened and financial conditions deteriorated, was that fixed exchange rates under the gold standard were vulnerable to speculative runs. Both types of policies were decried--and in some textbooks, still are--as having prolonged the Depression by disrupting trade patterns while leading to an ultimately fruitless and destructive battle over shrinking international markets.\n",

      " I appreciate this opportunity to speak to the business and finance students and faculty--as well as the practicing financial professionals--attending the University of Dayton's 13th annual RISE forum.1 Before I became Chairman, I had the pleasure of addressing the 5th annual forum as a member of the Board of Governors in 2005.2 At that time, I spoke about the implementation of monetary policy and how crucial effective communication is to that implementation. Effective communication in monetary policy is more important than ever, and I have little doubt that my current and former colleagues will provide you with insights about the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts to achieve the goals that the Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Federal Reserve Banks offer professional development opportunities for teachers to improve their ability to present lessons on personal finance topics. Among the lessons of the recent financial crisis is the need for virtually everyone--both young and old--to acquire a basic knowledge of finance and economics. Accordingly, in addition to ensuring that students graduate with the financial literacy skills they need to navigate in the modern financial world, we, as a society, must also make sure that adults have opportunities to gain these skills or to refresh what they have learned. I hope this innovative program, which I'm told is the world's largest student investment conference, succeeds in its ambitious goal of bringing together the current and future leaders of finance to focus on creating a better economic future.\n",

      " Successful strategies to rebuild communities cannot focus narrowly on a single problem, such as the physical deterioration of neighborhoods that suffered high rates of foreclosure. A local philanthropist, Tom Cousins, wanted to improve the quality of life in this neighborhood by de-concentrating its poverty.6 But he understood that East Lake's problems were interconnected: Replacing substandard housing would do little to attract families to the neighborhood if it lacked good schools, but schools couldn't perform well if students feared for their safety, arrived hungry, and were otherwise unprepared or unable to learn. For example, using data from 38 children's hospitals, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute found an association between rates of foreclosures and poor health in children, including the incidence of abuse.11 Health-related philanthropies are also investing in projects in low-income communities, ranging from projects to identify the health ramifications of proposed community improvements to increasing access to fresh food, by creating partnerships to subsidize grocery stores in low-income communities.12 Accelerating Transformative Development in Communities       These examples illustrate the benefits of broad-based collaboration for rejuvenating communities that, in some cases, have been in decline for decades. Community development leaders have no shortage of commitment to their goals, but with the insights you provide, together with the opportunities to learn from the experiences of other communities, they will be better prepared and thus more successful in meeting the very difficult challenges they face.\n",

      " For example, projected aggregate loan losses under this year's most stressful scenario (the so-called severely adverse scenario) were 7 percent lower than the comparable figure last year, in part because the riskiness of banks' portfolios continues to decline. Indeed, even under the severely adverse scenario of the latest stress test, the estimate of these firms' post-stress tier 1 common capital ratio is more than 2 percentage points higher than actual capital levels at the end of 2008.4 Higher capital puts these firms in a much better position to absorb future losses while continuing to fulfill their vital role in the economy. First, stress tests complement standard capital ratios by adding a more forward-looking perspective and by being more oriented toward protection against so-called tail risks; by design, stress tests help ensure that banks will have enough capital to keep lending even under highly adverse circumstances. Accordingly, our scenarios now generally incorporate not only the typical consequences of a severe recession but also, simultaneously, other adverse developments such as an exceptionally large decline in house prices, sharp drops in the value of stocks and other financial assets, or a worsening of global economic conditions more severe than might normally be expected to accompany a deep recession in the United States. Importantly, in specifying the severely adverse scenario, we seek to avoid adding to the procyclicality of the financial system.In other words, in applying stress tests, we do not want to inadvertently set a standard that is easier to meet in good times (when banks should be preparing for possibly tougher times ahead) than in bad times (when banks need to be able to use accumulated capital to support lending).\n",

      " Absent vulnerabilities, triggers might produce sizable losses to certain firms, investors, or asset classes but would generally not lead to full-blown financial crises; the collapse of the relatively small market for subprime mortgages, for example, would not have been nearly as consequential without preexisting fragilities in securitization practices and short-term funding markets which greatly increased its impact. First, measures of capital based on stress tests are both more forward looking and more robust to \"tail risk\"--that is, to extremely adverse developments of the sort most likely to foster broad-based financial instability. Differences in these factors help explain why the correction in equity markets in 2000 and 2001 did not induce widespread systemic disruptions, while the collapse in house prices and in the quality of mortgage credit during the 2007-09 crisis had much more far-reaching effects: The losses from the stock market declines in 2000 and 2001 were widely diffused, while mortgage losses were concentrated--and, through various financial instruments, amplified--in critical parts of the financial system, resulting ultimately in panic, asset fire sales, and the collapse of credit markets. For example, during the housing boom, the aggregate data accurately showed the outsized pace of home mortgage borrowing, but it could not reveal the pervasive deterioration in underwriting that implied a substantial increase in the underlying credit risk from that activity.11 More recently, gains in household net worth have been concentrated among wealthier households, while many households in the middle or lower parts of the distribution have experienced declines in wealth since the crisis.\n",

      " These innovations, by introducing mechanization, specialization, and mass production, fundamentally changed how and where goods were produced and, in the process, greatly increased the productivity of workers and reduced the cost of basic consumer goods. Health care has improved some since I was young; indeed, life expectancy at birth in the United States has risen from 70 years in 1963 to 78 years today, although some of this improvement is probably due to better nutrition and generally higher levels of income rather than advances in medicine alone. Extrapolating to the future, the conclusion some have drawn is that the sustainable pace of economic growth and change and the associated improvement in living standards will likely slow further, as our most recent technological revolution, in computers and IT, will not transform our lives as dramatically as previous revolutions have. A strong case can be made that the modernization of health-care IT systems would lead to better-coordinated, more effective, and less costly patient care than we have today, including greater responsiveness of medical practice to the latest research findings.4 Robots, lasers, and other advanced technologies are improving surgical outcomes, and artificial intelligence systems are being used to improve diagnoses and chart courses of treatment. And, importantly, as trade and globalization increase the size of the potential market for new products, the possible economic rewards for being first with an innovative product or process are growing rapidly.6 In short, both humanity's capacity to innovate and the incentives to innovate are greater today than at any other time in history.\n",

      " If you can get them to open up, they will tell you that today they are happy and satisfied in various measures, or not, and their personal stories will be filled with highs and lows and in-betweens. Will you keep learning and thinking hard and critically about the most important questions? Will you become an emotionally stronger person, more generous, more loving, more ethical? If you are not happy with yourself, even the loftiest achievements won't bring you much satisfaction. A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate--these are the folks who reap the largest rewards. Those most worthy of admiration are those who have made the best use of their advantages or, alternatively, coped most courageously with their adversities. I think most of us would agree that people who have, say, little formal schooling but labor honestly and diligently to help feed, clothe, and educate their families are deserving of greater respect--and help, if necessary--than many people who are superficially more successful. Honest error in the face of complex and possibly intractable problems is a far more important source of bad results than are bad motives.\n",

      " First, a stronger policy response to inflation--more like that observed in the 1950s--certainly would have helped.24 Second, Fed policymakers could have reacted to continued high readings on inflation by adopting a more realistic assessment of the economy's productive potential.25 Instead, policymakers chose to emphasize so-called cost-push and structural factors as sources of inflation and saw wage- and price-setting as having become insensitive to economic slack.26 This perspective, which contrasted sharply with Milton Friedman's famous dictum that \"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,\" led to Fed support for measures such as wage and price controls rather than monetary solutions to address inflation.27 A further obstacle was the view among many economists that the gains from low inflation did not justify the costs of achieving it.28 As you know, under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve in 1979 fundamentally changed its approach to the issue of ensuring price stability. By the end of the 1970s, Federal Reserve officials increasingly accepted the view that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, at least in the medium and longer term; they became more alert to the risks of excessive optimism about the economy's potential output; and they placed renewed emphasis on the distinction between real‑‑that is, inflation-adjusted‑‑and nominal interest rates.29 The change in policy framework was initially tied to a change in operating procedures that put greater focus on growth in bank reserves, but the critical change‑‑the willingness to respond more vigorously to inflation--endured even after the Federal Reserve resumed its traditional use of the federal funds rate as the policy instrument.30 The new regime also reflected an improved understanding of the importance of providing a firm anchor, secured by the credibility of the central bank, for the private sector's inflation expectations.31 Finally, it entailed a changed view about the dual mandate, in which policymakers regarded achievement of price stability as helping to provide the conditions necessary for sustained maximum employment.32 The Great ModerationVolcker's successful battle against inflation set the stage for the so-called Great Moderation of 1984 to 2007, during which the Fed enjoyed considerable success in achieving both objectives of its dual mandate.\n",

      " By bringing together community bankers, bank regulators, and researchers from academic institutions and government agencies, the conference will help us all to better understand the issues that are most important to the future of community banking. Community bankers recognize that their own success depends on the health of the communities they serve, which is why so many community bankers contribute locally as citizens and leaders as well as in their capacities as lenders and providers of financial services. Although community banks have some natural advantages, such as local knowledge and relationships, they also face significant challenges. As battle-scarred survivors of a financial crisis and deep recession, community bankers today confront a frustratingly slow recovery, stiff competition from larger banks and other financial institutions, and the responsibility of complying with new and existing regulations. The best way to understand the challenges that community bankers face is to talk to the bankers themselves, and we at the Federal Reserve do that regularly. Our meetings with the council have been extremely informative and have improved our ability to understand and respond to community bank concerns. Papers in this session examine whether community banks influence new-firm survival, whether equipment finance is a potential growth area for community banks, how community bank failures affect local economic performance, and whether community bank lending relationships in rural areas are fundamentally different from those in urban areas. The first will consider community bank performance, with papers looking at the effect of financial derivatives on community bank profitability, the characteristics of community banks that recovered from significant financial distress, the effect of distance between merging banks on postmerger performance, and the determinants of differences in profitability across community banks.\n",

      " Importantly, the improved monetary policy framework, together with other reforms, has thus far helped reduce Mexico's susceptibility to financial crises. When the recent financial crisis in the United States and other advanced economies threatened to spill over to Mexico, the inflation credibility enjoyed by the Bank of Mexico allowed it to counter economic weakness by easing monetary conditions, even though headline inflation was running above its target range at the time. Strong countercyclical policy actions of this type were unlikely to have been feasible in Mexico a few decades ago; with little in the way of inflation-fighting credibility and an immature financial sector, the monetary authority in earlier years was often forced to respond to a crisis by tightening monetary conditions, rather than loosening them, in an effort to limit capital flight, exchange rate depreciation, and increases in inflation. As in Mexico, the benefits of central bank independence in the United States have included low inflation, well‑anchored inflation expectations, and increased policy credibility, which contribute to a more stable overall economic environment. Indeed, during the recent financial crisis and the ensuing recession, the Fed has been able to take aggressive monetary policy actions to help stabilize the economy without dislodging longer-term inflation expectations. To ensure appropriate accountability, while also making monetary policy more effective, central banks in the United States, Mexico, and around the world have worked hard to increase their transparency over the past 20 years or so.\n",

      " Because the Panic of 1907 fit the archetype of a classic financial panic in many ways, it's worth discussing its similarities and differences with the recent crisis.3 Like many other financial panics, including the most recent one, the Panic of 1907 took place while the economy was weakening; according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a recession had begun in May 1907.4 Also, as was characteristic of pre-Federal Reserve panics, money markets were tight when the panic struck in October, reflecting the strong seasonal demand for credit associated with the harvesting and shipment of crops. As Stan Fischer reminded us following the international crises of the late 1990s, the problem of moral hazard has no perfect solution, but steps can be taken to limit it.8 First, regulatory and supervisory reforms, such as higher capital and liquidity standards or restriction on certain activities, can directly limit risk-taking. The Dodd-Frank Act, under the orderly liquidation authority in Title II, created an alternative resolution mechanism for SIFIs that takes into account both the need, for moral hazard reasons, to impose costs on the creditors of failing firms and the need to protect financial stability; the FDIC, with the cooperation of the Federal Reserve, has been hard at work fleshing out this authority.10 A credible resolution mechanism for systemically important firms will be important for reducing uncertainty, enhancing market discipline, and reducing moral hazard.\n",

      " One important reason is to better understand what historical experience can teach us about how best to respond to current challenges. Similarly, our commitment to safeguarding price stability is reinforced by memories of the costs of high inflation during the 1970s and the Federal Reserve's subsequent restoration of price stability under Chairman Volcker during the 1980s. Beyond the insights that the study of the Federal Reserve's first 100 years offer to economists, historians, and policymakers about how the Fed can best meet its objectives today and in the future, a second reason to mark the centennial is the opportunity it affords to educate young people about the Federal Reserve and its important role in promoting a healthy economy and stable financial system. The Fed's actions influence the overall strength and stability of the economy, as you know, but they also affect the cost of a mortgage, the prices of goods and services, and the health of the job market that your students are part of or will soon be entering. Similarly, for your students, it's impossible to understand the Great Depression, America's strong economic performance after World War II, or the recent financial crisis without learning about the Federal Reserve and the debates that have surrounded it. A more open Fed, in my view, is both a more effective and more democratically legitimate institution. The centennial may be just an accident of the calendar, but any time is a good time to help more people learn about the Fed and what it does to enhance the economic well-being of Americans.\n",

      " Indeed, the date in the guidance was pushed out twice in 2012--first to late 2014 and then to mid-2015--leaving the public unsure about whether and under what circumstances further changes to the guidance might occur.8 In December of last year, the FOMC addressed this issue by tying its forward guidance about its policy rate more directly to its economic objectives.9 Introducing so-called state-contingent guidance, the Committee announced for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remained stable and near target.10 This formulation provided greater clarity about the factors influencing the Committee's thinking about future policy and how that thinking might change as the outlook changed.11 As my colleagues and I have frequently emphasized, the conditions stated in this guidance are thresholds, not triggers. When, ultimately, asset purchases do slow, it will likely be because the economy has progressed sufficiently for the Committee to rely more heavily on its rate policies, the associated forward guidance, and its substantial continued holdings of securities to maintain progress toward maximum employment and to achieve price stability.18 In particular, the target for the federal funds rate is likely to remain near zero for a considerable time after the asset purchases end, perhaps well after the unemployment threshold is crossed and at least until the preponderance of the data supports the beginning of the removal of policy accommodation.\n",

      "  The UAB may justifiably take great pride in its many accomplishments during the past four decades. Among other achievements, the UAB has emerged as a key international and regional participant in developing policies that promote financial stability, economic integration, and sustainable development and prosperity. Now in its 10th and final year, the Financial Regulators' Initiative has sponsored more than 40 training programs and conferences throughout the MENA region, and it has provided many short-term, on-the-job training opportunities for MENA regulators with U.S. banking agencies. One of the most important goals is to ensure that banks hold more and higher-quality capital, and have sufficient liquid assets on hand, to be able to survive a market shock or severe economic downturn. Then as now, international or regional financial crises require a coordinated response to safeguard the stability of the world's financial system. To that end, the UAB can play an important regional role by facilitating efforts to address potential cross-border issues, and by providing a local platform for strong cooperation between home and host supervisors during normal and crisis periods. At your conference this week, I anticipate you will discuss the opportunities and challenges that lay ahead for your members. Among the topics, no doubt, will be the prospects for partnership between the public and private sectors, the importance of establishing institutions capable of managing crises, the effects of new regulatory and supervisory structures on the banking industry, and the role of the banking sector in promoting economic growth.\n",

      " Moreover, work on some of the Federal Reserve's most important challenges of the past few years--notably, achieving a full economic recovery from the crisis and putting in place a new financial regulatory system--is still ongoing. When the financial system teetered near collapse in 2008 and 2009, we responded as the 19th century British essayist Walter Bagehot advised, by serving as liquidity provider of last resort to stressed financial firms and markets.1 But we did so in an institutional environment that was very different, and in many ways much more complex, than the one that Bagehot knew. Moreover, although commercial banks suffered large losses and some came under significant pressure, the crisis hit particularly hard those nonbank institutions most dependent on wholesale funding, such as investment banks and securitization vehicles. We also more extensively monitor the financial system as a whole and, in cooperation with other agencies, have put in place stronger oversight of systemically important financial firms, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, tougher supervision, and a process for the orderly resolution of failed firms. And I would be remiss if I did not point out, especially with Paul and Alan here, that the Fed's recent communications innovations owe a great deal to developments like the monetary targeting framework devised under Chairman Volcker and the post-Federal Open Market Committee statement and qualitative forward guidance introduced under Chairman Greenspan. Clarity, transparency, and accountability help build public confidence in the Federal Reserve, which is essential if it is to be successful in fostering stability and prosperity.\n",

      " Given the well-known difficulties that economists have in forecasting even the next few quarters, I will happily point out one important advantage in making a 100-year forecast, which is that I won't be around to explain why the forecast went wrong. The ideal we seek is a combination of the researcher's intellectual rigor and the ability of the effective policymaker to navigate the messiness of the real world, a world that includes complex institutions and markets, imperfect and incomplete data, and often-unpredictable human behavior. Without the expertise and creativity embodied in the staff, it would have been impossible to develop the innovative policies required to meet, in the words of the Federal Reserve Act, the \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" we confronted during the recent financial crisis. The fight against inflation during Paul and Alan's times in office was critical for the nation's longer-term prosperity, and it required perseverance in the face of heavy criticism. More recently, of course, the Federal Reserve took controversial but necessary measures to arrest what was arguably the worst financial crisis in American history, helping to avert what likely would have been a much more severe economic downturn than the Great Recession we did experience. The ability of this institution to support a healthy economy--an economy with high levels of employment, low inflation, and a stable financial system--will require our continued efforts to engage in two-way communication--explaining our actions and, importantly, listening to what our fellow citizens have to say.\n",

      " I had long advocated increased transparency and, in particular, a more explicit policy framework as ways to make monetary policy more predictable and more effective. In the private sector, key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage, excessive dependence on unstable short-term funding, deficiencies in risk measurement and management, and the use of exotic financial instruments that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways. As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff noted in their prescient research, economic activity following financial crises tends to be anemic, especially when the preceding economic expansion was accompanied by rapid growth in credit and real estate prices.16 Weak recoveries from financial crises reflect, in part, the process of deleveraging and balance sheet repair: Households pull back on spending to recoup lost wealth and reduce debt burdens, while financial institutions restrict credit to restore capital ratios and reduce the riskiness of their portfolios. This discrepancy reflects a number of factors, including declines in participation, but an important reason is the slow growth of productivity during this recovery; intuitively, when productivity gains are limited, firms need more workers even if demand is growing slowly. The reasons for weak productivity growth are not entirely clear: It may be a result of the severity of the financial crisis, for example, if tight credit conditions have inhibited innovation, productivity-improving investments, and the formation of new firms; or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales, which have led firms to use capital and labor less intensively, or even mismeasurement.\n",

      " Over a period of decades, the financial system was tested repeatedly--the Latin American debt crisis, the savings and loan crisis, the Asian crisis, the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, and the stock market crashes of the late 1980s and early 2000s. Financial market participants can be bipolar--prone to fads, manias, myopia, panics, and depression; driven by short-term gain; and easily caught up in the madness of crowds. The emergence of such behavior among the largest and most interconnected financial institutions is particularly dangerous, since these institutions are linchpins in our financial system and their failure could cause significant damage to large numbers of counterparties and the system as a whole, as the examples of Lehman Brothers and American International Group demonstrate. To facilitate timely recognition of the emergence of systemic risk, we should design quantifiable indicators related to the three elements I just outlined: risk buildup at systemically important institutions and within the financial sector more broadly, positive correlations of risk among financial market participants, and interconnectedness among those participants. During the late stages of the housing boom, more than a few financial institution chief executive officers dismissed the warnings of their own risk managers with a wave of the hand. Financial institutions may be required to build capital buffers in good times, which they can run down in bad times, thereby limiting credit growth during booms and mitigating credit contraction in downturns.\n",

      " Since the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, the federal budget deficit has soared as the weak economy has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures and as necessary policy actions have been taken to help ease the recession and shore up the financial system. So long as the economy and financial markets continue to recover, the deficit should narrow relative to GDP over the next few years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces safety-net expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus and promote financial stability wind down. This ratio is projected to decline to around three by the time most of the baby boomers have retired in 2030, and further increases in average life expectancies may push this ratio down a little more in the years after that. A large federal debt will also limit the ability and flexibility of policymakers to address future economic stresses and other emergencies, a risk that is underscored by the critical fiscal policy actions that were taken to buffer the effects of the recent recession and stabilize financial markets in the wake of the crisis. Nonetheless, I am encouraged that the debate seems to be moving forward and is starting to touch on some broad principles that--if followed--would improve economic growth and make achieving sustainable fiscal policies at least somewhat easier. Job gains have continued to be subpar, and the unemployment rate remains near its highest level since the early 1980s; moreover, given the slow pace of economic growth, unemployment is likely to remain high for some time.\n",

      " The 12-month change in core PCE prices dropped from about 2-1/2 percent in mid-2008 to around 1‑1/2 percent in 2009 and declined further to less than 1 percent by late 2010.2 As inflation has trended downward, measures of underlying inflation have fallen somewhat below the levels of about 2 percent or a bit less that most Committee participants judge to be consistent, over the longer run, with the FOMC's dual mandate. However, recent research suggests that the increase in unemployment due to extended benefits is probably small relative to the overall increase in unemployment, and, regardless of its magnitude, the influence of extended unemployment benefits will disappear as the economy improves and extended benefits expire.16 Moreover, at least some of the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve appears to reflect cyclical rather than structural influences. In particular, low vacancies and elevated layoffs--likely driven by weak labor demand--can account for much of the increase in unemployment that has occurred since mid-2008.17 This observation is in accord with the recent behavior of inflation, which, as noted above, has trended down over the past three years, consistent with a decline in rates of resource utilization. A reasonable fear is that this process could go too far, encouraging potential borrowers to employ excessive leverage to take advantage of low financing costs and leading investors to accept less compensation for bearing risks as they seek to enhance their rates of return in an environment of very low yields.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " My reading of the evidence, which I will briefly review, is that both unconventional policy tools--the use of forward guidance and the purchases of longer-term securities--have proven effective in easing financial conditions and hence have helped mitigate the constraint associated with the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate. In particular, the consensus outlook of professional forecasters regarding the path of the funds rate shifted down markedly in the Blue Chip survey published at the beginning of February 2009 (the solid line) compared with the survey published two months earlier (the dashed line).3 A crucial feature of the FOMC's policy communications is that the Committee's forward guidance has been framed not as an unconditional commitment to a specific federal funds rate path, but rather as an expectation that is explicitly contingent on economic conditions. As shown in the right panel, a simulation of the FRB/US model--a macroeconometric model developed and maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--indicates that such a shift in policy expectations would be associated with a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate (solid line) and a somewhat higher path of core inflation (dashed line) over coming years. But the counterfactual scenario suggests that conditions would have been even worse in the absence of the Federal Reserve's securities purchases: The unemployment rate would have remained persistently above 10 percent, and core inflation would have fallen below zero this year. The right panel depicts the macroeconomic effects of the more rapid runoff of the balance sheet in terms of deviations from the baseline scenario: The unemployment rate (solid line) is significantly higher, and core PCE inflation (dashed line) is somewhat lower.\n",

      " Wrenching crises and economic distress, notably including the difficult experience of the past several years, have punctuated periods of solid growth, low inflation, and financial stability. I consider this distinction important in thinking about how to reduce the incidence and severity of future crises while preserving a prosperous global economy. Most important, declines in underwriting standards, breakdowns in lending oversight by investors and rating agencies, increased use of opaque financial products, and more-general inadequacies in risk management by private financial institutions helped foster a dangerous and unsustainable credit boom. In short, these failures rooted in the financial system interacted with weaknesses in the global monetary system to create stresses and instabilities that eventually triggered--and amplified--the recent financial crisis and subsequent recession. Improving the international financial system requires better management of national financial sectors and also enhanced international cooperation and coordination, because in a globalized economy with strong, complex, cross-border linkages, even domestic financial stresses can have serious international repercussions. This asymmetry has served to inhibit the global rebalancing process, and it could threaten the ongoing recovery: If deficit countries curtail spending without offsetting spending increases in the surplus countries, aggregate demand would decline, with adverse consequences for the global economy. Finally, although I have not addressed this concern in my remarks today, the expansion of public-sector deficits and debts in many countries poses very serious medium- to long-run risks for both the international monetary and financial systems that will need to be addressed.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, the price of Brent crude oil has risen more than 70 percent and the price of corn has more than doubled; more broadly, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of non-fuel commodity prices has risen roughly 40 percent. Although real activity in the EMEs slowed appreciably immediately following the financial crisis, those economies resumed expanding briskly by the middle of 2009 after global financial conditions began improving, with China--which has accounted for roughly half of global growth in oil consumption over the past decade--again leading the way. Moreover, if speculative transactions were the primary cause of rising commodity prices, we would expect to see mounting inventories of commodities as speculators hoarded such commodities, whereas in fact stocks of crude oil and agricultural products have generally been falling since last summer.2 A third concern expressed by some observers is that the exceptionally low level of U.S. interest rates has translated into excessive monetary stimulus in the EMEs. Some observers have argued that the high unemployment rate primarily reflects structural factors such as a longer duration of unemployment benefits and difficulties in matching available workers with vacant jobs rather than a deficiency of aggregate demand. Assuming these firms are unable to fully pass through higher input costs into prices, they will experience some compression in their profit margins, at least in the short run, thereby causing a decline in the marginal return on investment in most forms of equipment and structures.7 Moreover, to the extent that higher oil prices are associated with greater uncertainty about the economic outlook, businesses may decide to put off key investment decisions until that uncertainty subsides.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Does increased financial openness result in stronger economic growth and improved economic performance more generally? As I will discuss today, these issues are complicated, but I continue to believe that open capital markets offer significant benefits in terms of greater efficiency and improved standards of living, and that they represent a long-run goal to which policymakers should remain committed. For example, a spending boom that leads the economy to overheat could induce a rise in the country's currency and a decline in exports, restoring more normal conditions and avoiding an undesirable rise in inflation. Unhedged borrowing in foreign currencies creates an additional mismatch, where a sharp currency depreciation can dramatically boost debt burdens, push borrowers into insolvency, and, in a vicious circle, induce further curtailment of finance from abroad. Notably, a separate literature that considers the link between domestic financial development and growth finds somewhat stronger evidence for such a relationship.6 This research finds that countries with stronger domestic financial systems grow faster, partly because firms are better able to access financing from sources besides their own retained earnings.7 This finding suggests that the benefits of greater financial openness among countries may be larger than has been identified to date. The act will improve the monitoring of systemic risks, strengthen the supervision of systemically important institutions, support an effective resolution mechanism for large institutions, bring greater transparency to derivatives markets, and improve the effectiveness of consumer financial protection regulation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As many observers have argued, an environment of low and stable interest rates may encourage investor behavior that could potentially lead to the emergence of financial imbalances that could threaten financial stability.1 Monetary policy in the United States has been highly accommodative now for a number of years. But a sustained period of very low and stable yields may incent a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"reaching for yield,\" in which investors seek higher returns by purchasing assets with greater duration or increased credit risk. For example, with interest rates at very low levels for a long period of time, and in an environment of low volatility, investors, banks, and other market participants may become complacent about interest rate risk.2 Similarly, in such an environment, investors holding assets which entail exposure to greater credit risk may not fully appreciate, or demand proper compensation for, potential losses. To the extent that investors choose to take advantage of the readily available funding for less liquid assets, their use of leverage could rise quickly, increasing the risks of a disorderly deleveraging. Given the damage that financial imbalances can cause if not addressed in a timely fashion, I would not categorically rule out the use of monetary policy when dangerous imbalances are building and prudential steps seem ineffective. However, calibrating the magnitude of a monetary policy response to address financial imbalances--even assuming that these can be identified at an early stage--is difficult at best given the bluntness of the monetary policy tool and the uncertain lags with which it operates.\n",

      " According to one prominent survey, only 15 percent of homeowners expect house prices to increase over the next year, and barely half expect house price increases over the next five years.2 Largely because of the fall in house prices and the sustained high rate of unemployment, about 4-1/2 percent of mortgages in the United States are currently in foreclosure, and three or more payments have been missed on an additional 3-1/2 percent. For some homeowners, the loss in net worth was much larger; indeed, nearly one-fourth of homeowners saw their net worth drop by 50 percent or more.4 House prices have continued to decline, on net, since 2009, and at this time, more than one-fourth of mortgage borrowers are underwater--that is, have mortgage balances that exceed the current values of their homes. To investigate this issue further, researchers at the Federal Reserve classified neighborhoods into three broad categories: low and moderate income, middle income, and high income.6 A comparison of housing and mortgage market conditions in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods with conditions in high-income neighborhoods reveals several interesting facts.7 One notable fact is that house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods rose more than in other neighborhoods during the national boom in house prices, and subsequently fell more during the bust. Delinquency rates are higher, in part, because borrowers in these communities were more likely to end up in complicated or inappropriate mortgage products, unacceptably often as a result of unfair and deceptive lending practices.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Not surprisingly, the unemployment rate has declined only 1 percentage point from its high of about 10 percent near the end of 2009, and the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008. Second, the production and sale of motor vehicles declined sharply because of disruptions in global supply chains in the aftermath of the disastrous earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan last March. This time, in contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, concerns about further declines in home prices, and the substantial number of homeowners whose mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes. European leaders are strongly committed to addressing these issues and have begun to make some progress on them, but the need to obtain agreement among a large number of euro-zone countries to be able to put in place necessary backstops, as well as difficulties involved in addressing the fiscal imbalances in some of these countries, has slowed the process of developing and implementing solutions. Although U.S. economic growth was particularly slow during the first half of this year, I expect that the pace of recovery will pick up over coming quarters and that unemployment will resume a gradual decline toward its longer-run sustainable rate; moreover, I anticipate that the medium-term outlook for inflation will remain subdued.\n",

      " I am grateful for this opportunity to explain how we, together with other regulators, have been moving forward to fulfill our new responsibilities.1 The Dodd-Frank Act instituted substantial changes to financial-sector supervision and regulation in the United States in direct response to the serious deficiencies in the regulatory framework that were revealed, all too painfully, by the financial crisis and the associated deep recession. Therefore, the macroprudential approach focuses on achieving financial stability by reducing systemic risk‑‑that is, the risk of a financial disruption that is severe enough to inflict significant damage on the broader economy. Options for further reforms being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) include a mandatory floating NAV to mute the incentive for investors to be the first to redeem, capital buffers to allow funds to deal better with actual and potential losses while sustaining a stable NAV, and limits on redemptions both to provide more time for fund managers to address problems and to emphasize to investors that money market funds do not guarantee bank-like liquidity.3 The triparty repurchase agreement (repo) market also continues to exhibit important vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, these papers are encouraging‑‑at least to the further consideration of the use of cyclical policy tools‑‑and this literature, which also includes more theoretical analyses of such policies, is a vibrant and growing one that should yield useful insights in coming years.7 U.S. banking institutions have manageable levels of direct exposure to the peripheral European countries but more substantial links to financial institutions in the larger European economies.\n",

      "  In my remarks this morning I will underscore the urgency of strengthened international policy cooperation to attain strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the global economy--a theme that received emphasis at the Group of Twenty (G-20) Leaders' Summit in Cannes earlier this month. Moreover, high levels of unemployment and underemployment, slow gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets have weighed on household spending and diminished the ability of households to tap home equity in emergencies or for other purposes. Exhibit 5 shows that China's consumption share--the solid line--which was already well below that of other major economies in 2000, has fallen steadily over the past decade to about one-third of its GDP.2 Private consumption shares in other emerging Asian economies--the dashed line--are also significantly below those in the advanced economies--the dotted line--and have not moved up in the wake of the global financial crisis. Perhaps most important, since the ultimate goal of economic growth is to improve standards of living, allowing the currency to appreciate can help ensure that a greater proportion of output is devoted to household consumption, enabling social welfare to improve at a faster pace. In addition, downside risks to global growth have increased significantly because of rising financial market pressures, reflecting an intensification of stress in European banking and sovereign debt markets as well as broader concerns about the outlook.\n",

      " While migration within the United States has been trending down for some time, the reduction in mobility during the recession was not greater for homeowners than for renters, nor was it especially pronounced for areas where housing prices have declined the most and so where house lock would likely be most prevalent.4 Finally, I do not interpret data suggesting an outward shift in the Beveridge curve as providing much evidence in favor of an increase in structural unemployment. As can be seen, such counterclockwise movements also occurred during these two earlier deep recessions.6 While I do not see much evidence of any significant increase in structural unemployment so far, I am concerned that structural unemployment could increase over time if the labor market heals too slowly--a phenomenon known as hysteresis. One possibility, highlighted by Chairman Bernanke in a recent speech, is that last year's decline in unemployment represents a catch-up from the especially large job losses during late 2008 and 2009.7 According to this hypothesis, employers slashed employment especially sharply during the recession, perhaps out of concern that the contraction could become even more severe; in particular, the figure shows that in 2009, the unemployment rate rose by considerably more than the decline in GDP would have suggested. In particular, we know that recoveries from financial crises are commonly prolonged, and I remain concerned that the headwinds that have been restraining the recovery could lead to a longer period of sluggish growth and high unemployment than is embodied in the consensus forecasts.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Currently, the unemployment rate stands around 3 percentage points above where it was at the onset of the recession--a figure that is stark enough as it is, but does not even take account of the millions more who have left the labor force or who would have joined under more normal circumstances in the past four years. In the absence of this barrier, nominal gains in wages and unit labor costs would have likely been even more subdued given the severity of the economic downturn, with the result that inflation would probably now be running at a lower rate. At the same time, the fact that longer-term inflation expectations have not risen above 2 percent has also proved extremely valuable, for it has freed the FOMC to take strong actions to support the economic recovery without greatly worrying that higher energy and commodity prices would become ingrained in inflation and inflation expectations, as they did in the 1970s. However, federal fiscal policy could turn even more restrictive if the Congress does not reach agreement on several important tax and budget policy issues before the end of this year; in fact, the CBO recently warned that the potential hit to gross domestic product (GDP) growth could be sufficient to push the economy into recession in 2013.7 The deterioration of financial conditions in Europe of late, coupled with notable declines in global equity markets, also serve as a reminder that highly destabilizing outcomes cannot be ruled out. Continued high unemployment could wreak long-term damage by eroding the skills and labor force attachment of workers suffering long-term unemployment, thereby turning what was initially cyclical into structural unemployment.\n",

      " The recovery from the global recession of emerging market economies, especially in Asia, has been more robust, but even these economies are slowing in the face of weak global demand, and they would benefit from further progress toward a more balanced model of growth led by domestic demand. Economists at the Federal Reserve Board have added to the growing body of research analyzing recessions and their aftermath, focusing specifically on the factors that determine the pace of recovery once the economy has hit bottom.1 They find that recoveries tend to be faster following deeper recessions, but slower following long recessions. Greater reliance on domestic demand would not only help shield Asia's economic growth from the weakness in the advanced economies; it would also boost the well-being of its citizens by enabling them to consume a greater share of the output they produce. Japanese government spending helped propel the economy's bounceback from recession, but it has also added to public debt, which the International Monetary Fund now projects will rise to 237 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, the largest among the major advanced economies.2 Along with this high debt, aging of the population and slow GDP growth pose important concerns for fiscal sustainability. Japan would also benefit from measures to increase its potential growth, which is generally estimated to have fallen to less than 1 percent and could decline further as population aging progresses. Japan initially bounced back more quickly than other advanced economies from the global financial crisis, but its growth has slowed recently, and it also faces serious fiscal and structural challenges.\n",

      " In contrast, with low but positive inflation, they can be.13 History has shown that sustained periods of even mild deflation can impose immense costs in terms of slow growth and high unemployment.14 Thus, balancing the goal of maximum employment against the costs of modest inflation, the Committee chose 2 percent measured inflation as the value it judged likely to provide an adequate buffer against costly deflations while keeping the costs of inflation quite small. The Committee can act in this way because the FOMC can tolerate transitory deviations of inflation from its objective in order to more forcefully stabilize employment without needing to worry that the public will mistake these actions as the pursuit of a higher or lower long-run inflation objective. The more rapid reduction in unemployment along the optimal control path than in the baseline reflects the stimulus to demand provided by lower nominal and real interest rates, higher asset prices, and the expectation of more rapid growth in employment and income.19 The computation of an optimal path for monetary policy is obviously complicated, and, as I'll discuss, it's challenging to communicate. The public cannot, for example, infer whether a projection for higher inflation in 2015 was made by a participant who expects real activity to be weak due to a more pessimistic view about the productive capacity of the economy, or by a participant who expects higher inflation in the context of a stronger recovery, perhaps judging, in the spirit of the optimal policy simulations, that somewhat higher inflation is warranted for some time to achieve faster progress in reducing unemployment.\n",

      " Government spending on unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs rises in recessions, helping individuals hurt by the downturn and also supporting consumer spending and the broader economy by replacing lost income. These automatic declines in tax collections and increases in government spending are often supplemented with discretionary fiscal action--tax rate cuts, spending on infrastructure and other goods and services, and extended unemployment benefits. While a long-term plan is needed to reduce deficits and slow the growth of federal debt, the tax increases and spending cuts that would have occurred last month, absent action by the Congress and the President, likely would have been a headwind strong enough to blow the United States back into recession. Before the Great Recession, housing investment added an average of 1/2 percentage point to real GDP growth in the two years after each of the previous four recessions, considerably more than its contribution to growth at other times.6 During this recovery, in contrast, residential investment, on net, has contributed very little to growth since the recession ended. Following an extended boom in construction driven in large part by overly loose mortgage lending standards and unrealistic expectations for future home price increases, the housing market collapsed--sales and prices plunged and mortgage credit was sharply curtailed. For example, as I noted, the housing crisis left many homeowners with high loan-to-value ratios and damaged credit records, creating barriers to their access to credit, while the financial crisis led many banks to lend only to borrowers with higher credit scores.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The FOMC raises the federal funds rate when inflation threatens to rise above its objective or when economic activity appears likely to rise above sustainable levels. One view was that less disclosure would reduce the risk and tamp down suspicions that some could take advantage of disclosures more readily than others. With unemployment so far from its longer-run normal level, I believe progress on reducing unemployment should take center stage for the FOMC, even if maintaining that progress might result in inflation slightly and temporarily exceeding 2 percent. Specifically, the Committee said it anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate \"at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In its most recent statement, the FOMC also indicated that the pace and composition of the purchases may be adjusted based on the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases, as well as the extent of progress toward the Federal Reserve's economic objectives.13 In my view, adjusting the pace of asset purchases in response to the evolution of the outlook for the labor market will provide the public with information regarding the Committee's intentions and should reduce the risk of misunderstanding and market disruption as the conclusion of the program draws closer.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " With economic activity constrained by fiscal consolidation, the lingering effects from the financial crisis, and the added headwinds of Europe's recession and debt problems, most FOMC participants reported in December that they expected only a gradual decline in unemployment over the next two years, to about 7 percent by the end of 2014.4 The official estimate of 12 million currently unemployed does not include 800,000 more discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work.5  In addition, nearly 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working part time even though they would prefer full-time jobs. Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate \"at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. I've previously argued that, in such circumstances, optimal policy prescriptions for the federal funds rate's path diverge notably from those of standard rules.15  For example, David Reifschneider and John Williams have shown that when policy is constrained by the effective lower bound, policymakers can achieve superior economic outcomes by committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer than would be called for by the interest rate rules that serve as reasonably reliable guides for monetary policy in more normal times.16  Committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer helps bring down longer-term interest rates immediately and thereby helps compensate for the inability of policymakers to lower short-term rates as much as simple rules would call for.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Still, the discussion might not have gone much beyond \"one instrument and two targets\" if not for the financial crisis and its aftermath, which have presented central banks with great challenges and transformed how we look at this topic. For the past four years, a major challenge for the Federal Reserve and many other central banks has been how to address persistently high unemployment when the policy rate is at or near the effective lower bound. Of course, many central banks have, in the wake of the crisis, found it challenging to provide appropriate monetary stimulus after their policy interest rate hit the effective lower bound. Since December 2012, the Committee has said it intends to hold the federal funds rate near zero at least until unemployment has declined below 6-1/2 percent, provided that inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. The greater focus on financial stability is probably the largest shift in central bank objectives wrought by the crisis. I don't see pervasive evidence of rapid credit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset bubbles that would threaten financial stability. However, I think most central bankers view monetary policy as a blunt tool for addressing financial stability concerns and many probably share my own strong preference to rely on micro- and macroprudential supervision and regulation as the main line of defense.\n",

      "  Bank Regulatory BasicsThe financial crisis revealed that banking firms around the world did not have enough high-quality capital to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. We also were reminded during the crisis that a banking firm--particularly one with significant amounts of short-term wholesale funding--can become illiquid before it becomes insolvent, as creditors run in the face of uncertainty about the firm's viability. In this arena, the efforts of the Federal Reserve and the global regulatory community have focused principally on (1) producing stronger regulations to reduce the probability of default of such firms to levels that are meaningfully below those for less systemically important financial firms, and (2) creating a resolution regime to reduce the losses to the broader financial system and economy upon the failure of a SIFI. Toward that end, U.S. and global regulators have worked to improve the transparency and stability of the over-the-counter derivatives markets and to strengthen the oversight of financial market utilities and other critical financial infrastructure. The stability of the global financial system depends critically on the capital adequacy of global banks, the capital adequacy of global banks depends critically on the Basel III reforms, and much of the good progress in the BaselIII reforms rests on the integrity and strength of the risk weights. As they suggest, fully offsetting any remaining too-big-to-fail subsidies and forcing full internalization of the social costs of a SIFI failure may require either a steeper capital surcharge curve or some other mechanism for requiring that additional capital be held by firms that potentially pose the greatest risks to financial stability.\n",

      " When I accepted his offer, I promised the president I would do my very best, working with my Fed colleagues, to help restore the health of the economy and promote a strong and stable financial system. In that short time, the Board has taken significant steps to further strengthen financial regulation, and I have discharged one of my most important responsibilities, accounting for the Fed's actions and explaining its policies in our semi-annual report to Congress. I'll do more of that explaining in two weeks, when I respond to questions from the media after the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. More work lies ahead to complete implementation of Congress' plan for strengthening financial regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act. I will also continue the work of helping repair the damage done by the financial crisis to the economy. Our staff constitute one of the Fed's greatest strengths and I am proud to serve with individuals who exhibit the highest standards of professionalism and integrity. Their skill, creativity and perseverance enabled the Fed to do its part to meet the grave threats our nation faced in the financial crisis and then persevere in a disappointingly slow recovery. When we make progress toward our goals, each job that is created lifts this burden for someone who is better equipped to be a good parent, to build a stronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation.\n",

      " But I am glad that there is, each year, a time when we pause to think about the role of women, because history is more than simply what happened, and more than what women and men did to make it happen. For me, one lesson from history is that it is no coincidence that America's great success in the past century came as women steadily increased their participation in every aspect of society. Starting with gaining the vote, just a few years before International Women's Day, \"The American Century,\" as it's sometimes known, was also a century of progress for women. Fundamental to our country's values, to those ideals that have been and continue to be so influential around the world, is the principle of equality for all, including for women. One reason America's example is influential elsewhere is because progress toward these ideals has been accompanied by great success in broadly raising living standards. Women have made great progress in many occupations and professions, but lag in others. There are doubtless numerous reasons for this, and in fact economists themselves are among those engaged in trying to understand the factors that explain why more women aren't rising to higher levels. As we continue to make progress in recovering from the Great Recession, our country is going to need the best efforts, ideas and talent it can muster to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy.\n",

      " I'm delighted to have this opportunity to speak to you today, even though I am unable to be with you in person. But as we saw in the crisis, maturity transformation also exposes intermediaries to liquidity risk, particularly when intermediaries are heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding. The LCR is designed to improve a bank's ability to withstand severe short-term liquidity stress events by requiring banking firms to hold a buffer of highly liquid assets to cover net cash outflows in a 30-day stress scenario. In the case of the NSFR, requiring firms to use higher levels of stable funding for less liquid assets reduces the vulnerabilities of a firm to structural maturity mismatches. Some of these measures--such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of capital, stable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-term wholesale funding--would likely apply only to the largest, most complex banking organizations. While these cost-benefit questions are difficult to answer with either certainty or precision, let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains from introducing further reforms to address short-term wholesale funding risks. Factoring in the Basel III capital requirements and the NSFR, the Basel study suggested that tightening risk-based capital and liquidity requirements would, on net, provide economic benefits, and that benefits would continue to accrue at even higher levels of risk-based capital than are part of Basel III.\n",

      " Broader measures of unemployment that include workers marginally attached to the labor force and those working part time for economic reasons have fallen a bit more than the headline unemployment rate, and labor force participation, which had been falling, has ticked up this year. Similarly, while the share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have been looking for work for more than six months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it remains as high as any time prior to the Great Recession.5 There is ongoing debate about why long-term unemployment remains so high and the degree to which it might decline in a more robust economy. As I argued more fully in a recent speech, I believe that long-term unemployment might fall appreciably if economic conditions were stronger.6 The low level of labor force participation may also signal additional slack that is not reflected in the headline unemployment rate. With the federal funds rate currently near its lower limit, lower inflation translates into a higher real value for the federal funds rate, limiting the capacity of monetary policy to support the economy.9 Further, with longer-term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in recent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burden of debt for households and firms, which may put a drag on economic activity. FOMC participants have cited different reasons for this view, but many of the reasons involve persistent effects of the financial crisis and the possibility that the productive capacity of the economy will grow more slowly, at least for a time, than it did, on average, before the crisis.\n",

      " Too many people know firsthand how devastating it is to lose a job at which you had succeeded and be unable to find another; to run through your savings and even lose your home, as months and sometimes years pass trying to find work; to feel your marriage and other relationships strained and broken by financial difficulties. Since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the economy has added more than 7-1/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 3 percentage points to 6.7 percent. For Dorine and others, we know that workers displaced by layoffs and plant closures who manage to find work suffer long-lasting and often permanent wage reductions.4 Jermaine Brownlee was an apprentice plumber and skilled construction worker when the recession hit, and he saw his wages drop sharply as he scrambled for odd jobs and temporary work. Likewise, the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs is noticeably below levels before the recession; that is an indicator that people are reluctant to risk leaving their jobs because they worry that it will be hard to find another. Labor compensation has increased an average of only a little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical standards.5 Wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before the recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity, and those forces are undoubtedly still relevant.\n",

      " During the financial crisis, I saw firsthand the challenges that community banks faced in a crisis they did little to cause, and I have felt strongly ever since that the Fed must do what it can to ensure that the actions taken following the crisis do not place undue burdens on your institutions. Although there is still considerable revenue pressure from low margins, earnings for most community banks have rebounded since the financial crisis. While this expansion in lending must be prudent, on balance I consider this growth an encouraging sign of an improving economy. Addressing Too Big to Fail       Let me begin by discussing an issue that I know has been on the minds of many community bankers: how policymakers are addressing the problem of banks that are perceived to be too big to fail.1 Community banks share the interest we all have in reducing the systemic risk posed by firms that are large, complex, and interconnected, and also in reducing any potential competitive advantages that such firms may enjoy as a result of too-big-to-fail. CCAR helps ensure that the largest banking organizations will have enough capital to continue operating through times of economic and financial stress.2 To be clear, as the federal banking agencies have stated previously, these stress testing and capital planning requirements do not, and should not, apply to community banks.3 In addition to strengthening requirements for stress testing and capital planning, the agencies have also strengthened capital requirements for the largest firms by approving more robust risk-based and leverage capital requirements. In designing the revised capital rules, however, the agencies considered financial stability risks and adjusted the final rules to make the requirements substantially more rigorous for the largest, most systemically important banking organizations than for community banks.4 While we have taken a number of steps to address too-big-to-fail concerns, our work is not finished.\n",

      " After the onset of the crisis, the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to stabilize the financial system and halt the plunge in economic activity. By putting downward pressure on interest rates, the Fed is trying to make financial conditions more accommodative--supporting asset values and lower borrowing costs for households and businesses and thus encouraging the spending that spurs job creation and a stronger recovery. So far during this expansion, public-sector employment has declined and the private sector has accounted for all of the net increase in employment, so businesses have been even more crucial to job creation than usual. According to the latest data from the Labor Department, a little more than half of the net number of jobs created since employment began growing in 2010 has been generated by firms with fewer than 250 employees, and most of that amount was accounted for by firms with fewer than 50 employees.1 One of the reasons I wanted so much to be here this evening was to be able to acknowledge these important contributions. Although we have come far, it is also true that we have further to go to achieve a healthy economy, and I am certain that small businesses will continue to play a critical role in reaching that objective. You come from different places and have achieved success in a wide variety of ways, but you all share the entrepreneurial spirit that has always been central to our nation's prosperity.\n",

      " Kandel's life, I believe, demonstrates how a persistent curiosity can help us reach ambitious goals, even with great roadblocks in the way. These days, technology allows us access to a great breadth of perspectives, but it also allows us to limit what voices we hear to the narrow range we find most agreeable. It forces us to recognize, with humility, that we don't have a monopoly on the truth. Even Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio failed most of the time when they stepped to the plate. Finding the right path in life, more often than not, involves some missteps. My Federal Reserve colleagues and I experienced this as we struggled to address a financial and economic crisis that threatened the global economy. I learned the lesson during this period that one's response to the inevitable setbacks matters as much as the balance of victories and defeats. There is an unfortunate myth that success is mainly determined by something called \"ability.\" But research indicates that our best measures of these qualities are unreliable predictors of performance in academics or employment. Such circumstances may not be all that frequent, but in every life, there will be crucial moments when having the courage to stand up for what you believe will be immensely important.

      " In my assessment, macroprudential policies, such as regulatory limits on leverage and short-term funding, as well as stronger underwriting standards, represent far more direct and likely more effective methods to address these vulnerabilities.5 Recent International Experience       Turning to recent experience outside the United States, a number of foreign economies have seen rapidly rising real estate prices, which has raised financial stability concerns despite, in some cases, high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to the central bank's inflation target.6 These developments have prompted debate on how to best balance the use of monetary policy and macroprudential tools in promoting financial stability. A more balanced assessment, in my view, would be that increased focus on financial stability risks is appropriate in monetary policy discussions, but the potential cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to be too great to give financial stability risks a central role in monetary policy decisions, at least most of the time. The limitations of macroprudential policies reflect the potential for risks to emerge outside sectors subject to regulation, the potential for supervision and regulation to miss emerging risks, the uncertain efficacy of new macroprudential tools such as a countercyclical capital buffer, and the potential for such policy steps to be delayed or to lack public support.14 Given such limitations, adjustments in monetary policy may, at times, be needed to curb risks to financial stability.15 These first two principles will be more effective in helping to address financial stability risks when the public understands how monetary policymakers are weighing such risks in the setting of monetary policy.\n",

      "  In the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of employment in the United States since the Great Depression.1 More jobs have now been created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008. As an accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to increases in four factors: retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, including worker discouragement.8 Of these, greater worker discouragement is most directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the workforce. While structural factors have clearly and importantly affected each of these three trends, some portion of the decline in labor force participation resulting from these trends could be related to the recession and slow recovery and therefore might reverse in a stronger labor market.9 Disability applications and educational enrollments typically are affected by cyclical factors, and existing evidence suggests that the elevated levels of both may partly reflect perceptions of poor job prospects.10 Moreover, the rapid pace of retirements over the past few years might reflect some degree of pull-forward of future retirements in the face of a weak labor market. A third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility that, because of the dislocations of the Great Recession, transitory wage and price pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached, although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum employment.17 The argument is that workers who have suffered long-term unemployment--along with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but would return to work in a stronger economy--face significant impediments to reemployment.\n",

      " The Federal Reserve is committed to achieving further progress, and to better understanding the challenges to improving diversity throughout the economics profession. As an employer, the Fed is very serious about meeting its obligation to provide equal opportunity, and I also believe that diversity makes the Fed more effective in carrying out its mission, for reasons such as the one I mentioned a moment ago. To what extent might the lack of diversity among economics majors reflect a more general need to make basic economics more relevant and otherwise appealing to undergrads? The AEA has also done important work documenting and investigating the \"leaky pipeline,\" trying to determine why some groups are more likely to abandon economics education and work before, and even after, receiving Ph.D.s. To what extent are these disparities caused by differences in the experiences of those groups or due to broader and more general challenges faced in academia? All of you know that there has been a fair amount of public debate in recent years about the health of the economics profession, prompted in part by the failure of many economists to comprehend the dire threats and foresee the damage of the financial crisis. When this question is asked again someday, when economics is tested by future challenges, I hope that our profession will be able to say that we have done all we could to attract the best people and the best ideas.\n",

      "  The financial crisis and the Great Recession demonstrated, in a dramatic and unmistakable manner, how extraordinarily vulnerable are the large share of American families with very few assets to fall back on. We have come far from the worst moments of the crisis, and the economy continues to improve. Another likely reason for this decline in net worth is the lingering effects of the housing crisis. Home equity accounts for the lion's share of wealth for most families and many of these families have not yet recovered the wealth they lost in the housing crisis. The housing market is improving and housing will remain an important channel for asset building for lower and middle income families. But one of the lessons of the crisis, which will not be news to many of you, is the importance of diversification and especially of possessing savings and other liquid financial assets to fall back in times of economic distress. A larger lesson from the financial crisis, of course, is how important it is to promote asset-building, including saving for a rainy day, as protection from the ups and downs of the economy. I surely hope that our nation will not face another crisis anytime soon as severe as the one we recently experienced. But for many lower-income families without assets, the definition of a financial crisis is a month or two without a paycheck, or the advent of a sudden illness or some other unexpected expense.\n",

      "  The distribution of income and wealth in the United States has been widening more or less steadily for several decades, to a greater extent than in most advanced countries.1 This trend paused during the Great Recession because of larger wealth losses for those at the top of the distribution and because increased safety-net spending helped offset some income losses for those below the top. There have been some times of relative prosperity when income has grown for most households but inequality widened because the gains were proportionally larger for those at the top; widening inequality might not be as great a concern if living standards improve for most families. Based on rising home prices alone and not counting possible changes in mortgage debt or other factors, Federal Reserve staff estimate that between 2013 and mid-2014, average home equity rose 49 percent for the lowest half of families by wealth that own homes.12 The estimated gains are somewhat less for those with greater wealth.13 Homeowners in the bottom 50, which had an average overall net worth of $25,000 in 2013, would have seen their net worth increase to an average of $33,000 due solely to home price gains since 2013, a 32 percent increase. Figure 10 shows that from 1995 to 2013, outstanding education debt grew from 26 percent of average yearly income for the lower half of households to 58 percent of income.34 The education debt burden was lower and grew a little less sharply for the next 45 percent of families and was much lower and grew not at all for the top 5 percent.35 Opportunities to Build Wealth through Business OwnershipFor many people, the opportunity to build a business has long been an important part of the American dream.\n",

      "  The suddenness and severity of the global financial crisis forced policymakers to respond rapidly and creatively, employing a wide range of macroeconomic tools--including both monetary and fiscal policies--to arrest a steep economic downturn and restart the global economy. A portion of this stimulus reflected the operation of automatic stabilizers--higher unemployment benefits, for example, and a decline in tax payments due to lower incomes--and some came through cuts in tax rates and increases in discretionary spending. Expansive fiscal policy served to raise deficits in most countries, some of which faced further costs from stabilizing financial institutions, pushing deficits even higher. Policy during the Recovery       The combination of increasing debt and depressed output led to rising ratios of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in many advanced economies and heightened concern about whether the growth in debt could be sustained without unsettling financial markets. This sluggishness has been due in part to the severity of the financial shock associated with the crisis and the persistent headwinds to recovery in its aftermath. The first is that governments need to address long-term challenges and significantly improve their structural fiscal balances during good times so they have more fiscal space to provide stimulus when times turn bad. When poor economic conditions drive policy interest rates close to the zero lower bound, fiscal stimulus may be more effective than usual in boosting aggregate demand because it will not have the usual effect of raising real interest rates, thereby crowding out private demand.2 A second lesson is that, while even if it is appropriate for fiscal policy to play a larger role when policy rates are near zero, policymakers nevertheless may face constraints in implementing fiscal stimulus.\n",

      " Market participants lost confidence in their trading partners, and, as the crisis unfolded, the financial sector struggled to cope with a massive withdrawal of liquidity, the collapse of one of its most prominent institutions, and a 40 percent drop in equity prices.2 The effects of the crisis were felt far beyond the financial sector as credit dried up and a mild recession became something far worse. As shown in figure 1, between 2000 and 2007, the notional value of collateralized debt obligations outstanding increased from less than $300 billion to more than $1.4 trillion.4 From 2004, the earliest date for which comprehensive data are available, to 2007, the outstanding notional amount of credit default swap (CDS) contracts increased tenfold, from $6 trillion to $60 trillion.5 This incredible growth in securitization and derivatives markets reflects a significant increase in the number, types, and complexity of network connections in the financial system. In their classic paper on bank runs, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig showed how rational and prudent actions by individual depositors to limit their own risks may be highly destabilizing to an institution designed to transform short-term liabilities into long-term assets.8 Xavier Freixas, Bruno Parigi, and Jean-Charles Rochet show that a similar kind of collective action problem can arise in a network akin to a modern check-clearing system in which credit extensions among banks allow claims on one institution to be fulfilled by another.9 Such a system is socially useful because it allows depositors to shift funds among banks without forcing banks to sell illiquid assets, thus enabling society as a whole to undertake more productive, long-term investment.\n",

      " There are also indications that wage growth is picking up, and weekly earnings for younger workers have made strong gains over the past couple of years. That is probably one reason why younger workers reported feeling significantly more optimistic about the job market compared with 2013, according to a survey published just today by the Federal Reserve.1 But it also looks like the economic gains of the past few years are finally raising living standards for most people. Those who graduate and enter the workforce during a strong economy are more likely to find employment, remain employed, and enjoy persistently higher earnings.3 The second reason for optimism is that you have already done the one thing that research shows is most important to a successful and stable working life: earning the degrees you will receive today. Beyond these advantages, research also shows that a college or graduate degree typically leads to a happier, healthier, and longer life.4 One explanation for the greater advantage in recent decades conferred by higher education is that it reflects an increase in the demand for educated workers compared with others. What is considerably more certain, however, is that success will continue to be tied to education, in part because a good education enhances one's ability to adapt to a changing economy. One reason for the increasing economic advantage of a college or graduate degree is the very slow growth of earnings in the last few decades for those with only a high school education.\n",

      " Given New York's preeminence as a center of global finance, I thought it would be appropriate to discuss just such a topic, which is how the Federal Reserve oversees the largest financial institutions, many of which are headquartered or have a major presence here, and how that oversight has strengthened since the financial crisis.1 The Financial Crisis and Large Financial Institutions       The crisis had many causes, including the numerous factors that drove a lengthy housing boom and the expansion of a largely unregulated \"shadow banking system\" rivaling the traditional banking sector in size. While this approach may have appeared to be an easy source of profit, it had the disadvantage of leaving those banks exposed to devastating runs if short-term funding dried up, as it did in the crisis. The plans developed by the largest firms to date still have a number of shortcomings, but the Federal Reserve has asked for and expects these institutions to make substantial progress in the coming months which will leave firms and the government better positioned to manage the failure of a large institution in an orderly way.13 The goal, through this and other actions I have described today, is to do whatever can be done to avert the dire threat and lasting damage of a severe financial crisis. We cannot eliminate the possibility of another crisis, but we can make a crisis less likely and less damaging by limiting excessive risk-taking by firms we oversee and by helping ensure that the most systemically important firms are better prepared to weather a crisis.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In advanced economies still feeling the effects of the Great Recession, people worry that children will grow up to be worse off financially than their parents were. In 2007, Chairman Bernanke delivered a speech on the causes of rising inequality that raised questions about the implications of this disturbing trend for economic opportunity‑-the topic that will be explored at this conference today and tomorrow.2 Chairman Bernanke's speech called for more research to understand the causes and the effects of widening inequality in the United States. Last October, I drew on the Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances--a rich source of data for researchers in this field--to explore some factors that may influence economic mobility, such as access to quality education and ownership of a family business, and I discussed how those factors may have changed over time.3 But I noted the difficulty of reaching definitive conclusions and, like Chairman Bernanke, expressed my hope that more research would be dedicated to finding answers to these important questions. Researchers and policymakers need a better understanding of how much mobility individuals may experience over the course of their lives and at what age people's outcomes may become more difficult to change. And there is also a community development analogue to economic mobility: Further research may help us better understand why some communities succeed or fail in generating jobs, developing successful small businesses, attracting infrastructure investment, and so on.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In particular, and despite the somewhat disappointing tone of the recent retail sales data, I think consumer spending is likely to expand at a good clip this year given such robust fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower energy prices, continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of consumer confidence. Research suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming constrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the more severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current policy should lean in accommodative direction.12 In effect, such a strategy represents insurance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and a faster rise in inflation under the modal outlook. Since long-term yields reflect the market's probability-weighted average of all possible short-term interest rate paths, along with compensating term and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in advanced economies suggests that investors place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in participants' modal SEP projections.14 A final argument for gradually adjusting policy relates to the desirability of achieving a prompt return of inflation to the FOMC's 2 percent goal, an objective that would be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level.\n",

      " Many financial innovations, such as the increased availability of low-cost mutual funds, have improved opportunities for households to participate in asset markets and diversify their holdings.2 Expanded credit access has helped households maintain living standards when suffering job loss, illness, or other unexpected contingencies.3 Technological innovations have increased the ease and convenience with which individuals make and receive payments.4 The contribution of the financial sector to household risk management and business investment, as well as the significant contribution of financial-sector development to economic growth, has been documented in many studies.5 Such research shows that, across countries and over time, financial development, up to a point, has disproportionately benefited the poor and served to alleviate economic inequality.6 Distorted Incentives in the Financial Sector       Despite these benefits, as we have seen, actions by financial institutions have the potential to inflict harm on society. Recent research has raised important questions about the benefits and costs of the rapid growth of the financial services industry in the United States over the past 40 years.7 A combination of responses to distorted incentives by players throughout the financial system created an environment conducive to a crisis. Large, complex institutions and too big to fail       In the aftermath of the crisis, the Congress tasked the banking regulators with challenging and changing the perception that any financial institution is too big to fail by ensuring that even very large banking organizations can be resolved without harming financial stability.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " U.S. economic output fell more than 4 percent nationally, the most since the Great Depression, and many of the hardest-hit industries, including housing construction and manufacturing, are important to the Rhode Island economy.1 The Federal Reserve took action to help stabilize the financial system during the crisis, and we have supported the economic recovery with monetary policy actions designed to hold down longer-term interest rates. One sign of a stronger labor market is that the number of job openings has risen impressively, and another is that more workers are quitting their jobs, signaling greater confidence in their ability to find a new job. The notion that inflation can be too low may sound odd, but over time low inflation means that wages as well as prices will rise by less, and very low inflation can impair the functioning of the economy--for example, by making it more difficult for households and firms to pay off their debts. Inflation has been held down by the continued economic weakness during the slow recovery and, more recently, by lower prices of imported goods as well as the fall in oil prices. For many reasons, output and job growth over the next few years could prove to be stronger, and inflation higher, than I expect; correspondingly, employment could grow more slowly, and inflation could remain undesirably low. Others are more optimistic, suggesting that recent technological innovation remains as impressive as ever, and that history shows it may take some years to fully reap the economic benefits of such innovations.7 I do not know who is right, but I do believe that, as a nation, we should be pursuing policies to support longer-run growth in productivity.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In response to the financial crisis, the severe recession, and the risk that inflation would fall persistently far below levels consistent with price stability, we at the Federal Reserve took forceful actions. It continued to decline substantially after the recession ended, with the pace of those declines slowing only over the past year or so even as the unemployment rate has continued to fall. And, indeed, a noticeable portion of the decline in labor force participation seen over the past decade or so clearly relates to the aging of baby boomers and their ongoing retirements.2 However, the pace of decline in the participation rate accelerated during the recession, as some individuals who lost their jobs became discouraged and stopped looking for work. For example, the rate at which employees quit their jobs for other opportunities has tended to go up in a strong economy, since more workers voluntarily leave their jobs when they have greater confidence about their ability to find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires. However, persistently low price inflation, which can tend to slow the pace of wage increases over time, can weaken the economy by, for example, making it more difficult for households and firms to pay off their debts. I mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years, and while I do think that this is evidence of some persisting labor market slack, it also may reflect, at least in part, fairly weak productivity growth.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Remarkably, this stability is estimated to have continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the unemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981-82 downturn, when the trend did shift down markedly.4 As I will discuss, the stability of this trend appears linked to a change in the behavior of long-run inflation expectations--measures of which appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an improvement in the conduct of monetary policy. This limitation is a potentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may require pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full employment at a satisfactory pace.10 For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation objective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent with the other leg of the FOMC's mandate, to promote maximum employment.11 An unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly because it increases the debt burdens of borrowers. And if the increased debt-service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to force borrowers into bankruptcy, then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small business owners, and laid-off workers may be very severe.13 Monetary Policy Actions since the Financial CrisisAs I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of inflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational definition of its longer-run price objective.14 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, however, achieving both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in figure 4.\n",

      " If this year's conference comes even close to being as successful as the first two were, and I expect it will be, I hope that we have established an ongoing role for this gathering, which provides such a great opportunity for bankers, regulators, and academic researchers to come together to share ideas and insights about the issues that matter most in community banking. Based on the agenda and conference materials I have seen, I expect participants over the next two days will tackle some of the most important issues facing community banks, provoke discussion and debate about opportunities and challenges, and generate some promising ideas about how community banks can continue to play the indispensable role they have played in so many communities. In the interest of getting to the important work of this conference, I will be brief, but if I accomplish anything by speaking to you today, I hope it is to convey the Board's understanding of the unique and important role of community banks in our financial system as well as the Board's commitment, at the highest level, to consider how our supervisory and regulatory decisions affect those institutions. Although community banks largely kept to their traditional business model of prudent, local lending and avoided the excessive risk-tasking that helped fuel the financial crisis, that crisis, and the deep recession that followed, devastated many communities and the banks that serve them. We have heard many comments about community bank concerns and are taking those insights into account as we consider options for alleviating unnecessary regulatory burden. The Fed instituted this conference in partnership with the CSBS because we believe that research can help us better understand the benefits that community banks provide to society and the challenges they face.\n",

      "  In 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, the federal government created an agency with the mission of providing detailed and objective information on American workers. Under Carroll Wright, what was then called the Bureau of Labor investigated major labor disputes and issued reports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action and legislation. The respect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that Wright oversaw led to the dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and later raised public awareness about the deplorable conditions faced by women in the workplace. One reason for this success, I am sure, is that she rose from the ranks, and the values of the BLS were deeply ingrained in her over the 28 years she served this agency. In her 13 years as commissioner, Janet succeeded in winning support for an ambitious expansion of the BLS. In this circumstance, the BLS was sometimes accused of overstating economic problems, and it occasionally came under pressure to alter the basis for its data. Janet Norwood fended off these challenges with a mixture of resolve and flexibility, channeling some of the pressure into deliberate and constructive processes that eventually yielded improvements in the consumer price index and generated alternative price measures. As commissioner and like her predecessors, Janet helped preserve the BLS's deserved reputation for accuracy and integrity by continually improving the design, procedures, and techniques of data collection.\n",

      "  It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board's conference on \"Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period.\" The conference aims to bring together academic and central bank economists, financial market practitioners, and policymakers to stimulate debate and research on a topic that is critically important to the Federal Reserve's mission of conducting monetary policy in the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices. The global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy, and it altered the way many think about monetary policy. At the peak of the crisis and during its immediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world. The post-crisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy and operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the effectiveness of different policy options. Specifically, policymakers have to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of alternative monetary implementation frameworks in the presence of new policy tools. Moreover, policymakers should be mindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from the intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed by the crisis. Looking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will deliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary policy. As I have often stressed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary policy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously its role as a research institution.\n",

      " This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth has been roughly neutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and fiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on growth.4 Also, the budget situation for many state and local governments has improved as the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing them to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of the Great Recession. Convincing evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have moved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations about inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of our 2 percent inflation goal more difficult. These headwinds have included tighter underwriting standards and limited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government, weak growth abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12 As the restraint from these headwinds further abates, I anticipate that the neutral federal funds rate will gradually move higher over time. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well; conversely, if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate would likely rise more slowly.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Thus, the current stance of monetary policy appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential growth and further improvements in the labor market.4 Looking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which include weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the end of the recession. During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal Reserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic disruptions--a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and employment. In addition, the public's expectation that the Fed will respond to economic disturbances in a predictable manner to reduce or offset their potential harmful effects means that the public is apt to react less adversely to such shocks--a response which serves to stabilize the expectations underpinning hiring and spending decisions.12 Such a stabilizing effect is one consequence of effective communication by the FOMC about its outlook for the economy and how, based on that outlook, policy is expected to evolve to achieve our economic objectives. Research suggests that, all else being equal, increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates call for greater gradualism under optimal policy than would be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That combination of solid labor market gains and moderate GDP growth reflects the fact that labor productivity growth has been unusually weak in recent years, averaging less than 1/2 percent per year since 2010.9 Over time, productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living standards, supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers. The notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but very low inflation typically means very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset adverse shocks to the economy, thereby increasing the chances that recessions and the associated job losses would be more severe and persistent. In recent years, the neutral rate has likely been held down below normal levels because of the factors I discussed earlier, including persistently weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low rates of household formation, and weak productivity growth. The notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but very low inflation typically means very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset adverse shocks to the economy, thereby increasing the chances that recessions and the associated job losses would be more severe and persistent.

      "----------------------\n",
      " Another key factor is the marked decline over the past decade, both here and abroad, in the long-run neutral real rate of interest--that is, the inflation-adjusted short-term interest rate consistent with keeping output at its potential on average over time.16 Several developments could have contributed to this apparent decline, including slower growth in the working-age populations of many countries, smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies, a decreased propensity to spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late 1990s, and perhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide.17 Although these factors may help explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad, our understanding of the forces driving long-run trends in interest rates is nevertheless limited, and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain.18 Would an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed's ability to fight recessions? It shows simulated paths for interest rates, the unemployment rate, and inflation under three different monetary policy responses--the aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint, the constrained aggressive rule, and the constrained aggressive rule combined with $2 trillion in asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by staying lower for longer.21 As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall far below zero if policy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to fall sharply.i But despite the lower bound, asset purchases and forward guidance can push long-term interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case (especially when adjusted for inflation) by reducing term premiums and increasing the downward pressure on the expected average value of future short-term interest rates.\n",

      "  I think the Kansas City Fed is an excellent place to discuss this issue because of the recognition it has received for promoting diversity and inclusion, both among businesses and other organizations in the 10th District and in its own ranks. I know that the Bank is continuing to hold Diversity Summits with firms and community groups, the most recent of which was last month. In various ways, it is also promoting diversity among its own staff and senior leaders through recruiting, hiring and promotions, and is closely tracking progress. Every day, in serving customers, bankers can see the strength that comes from diversity--the wisdom of diversification in investment decisions, in diverse product lines for the businesses you lend to, and especially in the strength of diverse communities. It helps ensure that individuals within those organizations have the opportunity to shine and employ their talents to the fullest and that their best ideas are heard and acted on. The banks you serve are better able to reach new customers, especially groups of customers who have historically been underbanked, when they show that serving those customers is a top priority. And one of the most effective ways of showing a commitment to a diverse customer base is showing a commitment to a diverse workforce. Demographic trends indicate that minorities will be an increasing share of the population in the years and decades ahead, and thus an increasing share of new customers for your institutions.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Several recent studies present cross-country evidence indicating that severe and persistent recessions have historically had these sorts of long-term effects, even for downturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a shock to aggregate demand.4 With regard to the U.S. experience, one study estimates that the level of potential output is now 7 percent below what would have been expected based on its pre-crisis trajectory, and it argues that much of this supply-side damage is attributable to several developments that likely occurred as a result of the deep recession and slow recovery.5 In particular, the study finds that in the wake of the crisis, the United States experienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a result of reduced immigration and a fall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and demographic factors, as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of labor productivity. At the household level, recent research finds that heterogeneity can amplify the effects of adverse shocks, a result that is largely driven by households with very little net worth that sharply increase their savings in a recession.9 At the firm level, there is evidence that financial constraints had a particularly large adverse effect on employment at small firms and the start-up of new firms, factors that may be part of the explanation for the Great Recession's long duration and the subsequent slow recovery.10 More generally, if larger firms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones, overall growth in investment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across different types of businesses.\n",

      "  I am very much looking forward to hearing from you about teaching economics, and I am eager to respond to your questions. First and foremost, of course, like all teachers, you are helping prepare your students for successful and rewarding lives. Like some other subjects students encounter in school, economics teaches analytical and critical thinking skills that can aid in the development and success of anyone. Part of success for your students is economic success--as capable, creative, and productive members of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances. Everyone is engaged in and depends on the economy, and nothing is more critical to a healthy and growing economy than the capability, creativity, and productiveness of its workforce. Whenever I am asked what policies and initiatives could do the most to spur economic growth and raise living standards, improving education is at the top of my list. Consumers skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times, and stronger household finances overall can help sustain growth, stabilize the economy, and mitigate an economic downturn. When successful, monetary policy can be a powerful and effective tool to these ends, but its capabilities are dwarfed by larger factors such as the productivity of the workforce and the strength of household finances. Research assistants who volunteer for FedEd visit schools; help teach about the Fed, economics, and finance; and answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.\n",

      " When the economy is weak and unemployment is on the rise, we encourage spending and investing by pushing short-term interest rates lower. Similarly, when the economy is threatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rates to keep the economy on a sustainable path and lean against its tendency to boom and then bust. There are always a certain number of people who are temporarily between jobs after having recently lost a job or having left one voluntarily to pursue better opportunities. It's important to try to estimate the unemployment rate that is equivalent to maximum employment because persistently operating below it pushes inflation higher, which brings me to our price stability mandate. Based on research and decades of experience, we define that level as 2 percent a year--an inflation objective similar to that adopted by most other major central banks.1 Individual prices, of course, move up and down by more than 2 percent all the time. Deflation is a general and persistent decline in the level of prices, a phenomenon Americans last experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s and one that Japan has confronted for most of the past two decades. While each of these factors has likely played a role in slowing productivity growth, the extent to which they will continue to do so is an open question.2 Why does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest rate?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely disappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other secular trends.3 Based on this array of labor market indicators, I judge labor utilization to be reasonably close to its normal longer-run level while also recognizing that estimates of the sustainable levels of the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio are inherently imprecise.4 In the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor market conditions as the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace--a view that is shared by most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).5 Overall economic growth has been driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered by substantial gains in household income and wealth. As we look to broader trends, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces depressing both supply and demand, including slow labor force and productivity growth, weak growth abroad, and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis. First, the pace of labor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years: For example, average payroll gains moderated from 250,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000 last year, and the unemployment rate declined 1-3/4 percentage points cumulatively over 2014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage point last year.7 Second, economic growth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the ongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that I mentioned, particularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually less accommodative. The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong labor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other financial imbalances, although such risks would likely take time to emerge.9 Finally, waiting too long to tighten policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In particular, once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it became necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary accommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently low inflation.7 Those tools--especially our large-scale securities purchases and increasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal funds rate--enabled the Federal Reserve to provide necessary additional support to the U.S. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally. The U.S. economy made notable progress toward the FOMC's statutory goals during 2014, with the unemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year--well below its Great-Recession peak of 10 percent--and other measures of labor market conditions also showing improvement: Payroll gains were solid; job openings had risen significantly; and the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs--a sign of confidence in the labor market--was rising back toward pre-crisis levels. For instance, as we noted in our latest Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, the ongoing expansion has been the slowest since World War II, with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year.12 This subdued pace reflects, in part, slower growth in the labor force in recent years--compared with much of the post-World War II period--and disappointing productivity growth both in the United States and abroad.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " However, the rate was nearly double, 5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11 While high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish high school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree.12 The advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for African Americans and Hispanics. At least partially because of a lack of early childhood education and the sometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially lower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates.13 Thus, a starting point is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality of primary and secondary schooling. The Federal Reserve's 2013 Survey of Young Workers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19 Other studies have found that students who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher wages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs improved participants' attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic aspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills.20 The findings point to some of the reasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called Pocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-year-olds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and reinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication.\n",

      " As a result, policymakers took extraordinary measures: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sharply cut the federal funds rate, and the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Treasury Department and other agencies, extended liquidity facilities beyond the traditional banking sector, applying to the modern structure of U.S. money markets the dictum of Walter Bagehot, conceived in the 19th century, to lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate.5 Still, the deterioration in the financial sector continued, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failing in early September.6 But the deterioration from early 2007 until early September 2008‑‑already the worst financial disruption in the United States in many decades‑‑was a slow trickle compared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial sector that September and led to a plunge in economic activity in the following months­. Given the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending, rulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that balanced the possible stability gains from greater loss-absorbing capacity against the possible adverse effects on lending and economic growth.24 This ex ante assessment pointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards--and subsequent research supports this assessment.25 The steps to improve the capital positions of banks promptly and significantly following the crisis, beginning with the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, have resulted in a return of lending growth and profitability among U.S. banks more quickly than among their global peers.\n",

      " Although the unemployment rate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization, some indicators have shown less improvement since the financial crisis.10 As the solid blue line in figure 6 illustrates, the employed share of the \"prime-age worker\" population--that is, persons from ages 25 to 54--remains noticeably below the 2007 level.11 But employment rates for this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining employment opportunities for less-skilled workers, a rising number of people receiving disability insurance, and other worrisome trends.12 Similarly, although the share of part-time workers who would like a full-time job is still somewhat above where it stood before the last two recessions (the dashed red line), it could reflect a structural change in firms' reliance on part-time labor.13 In addition, these two measures have to be weighed against other labor indicators that have either returned to, or are currently above, their pre-recession levels. But growth in average hourly earnings (the solid blue line) and the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker (the long-dashed black line) have clearly picked up.14 In addition, productivity growth has been quite weak in recent years, and empirical analysis suggests that it is has been holding down aggregate growth in labor compensation independent of labor utilization in recent years.15 An analysis of the pattern of wage growth at the U.S. state level also suggests that subdued growth for the country as a whole probably reflects sluggish productivity or some other factor common to all states, because cross-state differences in wage growth are about what one would expect given cross-state differences in unemployment rates.16 Finally, I would note that the percentage of firms planning wage increases has moved back up to its pre-recession level, many firms report difficulties in finding qualified workers, and some have responded by expanding training programs and offering signing bonuses--possible harbingers of stronger wage gains to come.\n",

      " Starting with the labor market, through August, payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per month this year, down only a little from the average pace of gains in 2016 and still well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate, which seems not to have been noticeably affected by the hurricanes, declined further to 4.2 percent, down about 1/2 percentage point from the end of 2016 and below the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. The hurricanes will likely result in some hit to GDP growth in the third quarter but a rebound thereafter, and smoothing through those movements, I'm expecting growth that continues to exceed potential in the second half of the year. My fellow FOMC participants and I perceive that risks to global growth have receded somewhat and expect growth to continue to improve over the near term. My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and with the ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next year. To be sure, our understanding of the forces that drive inflation is imperfect, and we recognize that this year's low inflation could reflect something more persistent than is reflected in our baseline projections. Of course, there are also risks that could unexpectedly boost inflation more rapidly than expected, such as resource utilization having a stronger influence when the economy is running closer to full capacity.\n",

      " Nearly 10 years ago, with our nation mired in its worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) confronted a key challenge to the pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability: how to support a weakening U.S. economy once our main conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, had been lowered to essentially zero. Indeed, the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities purchases--by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of American families and businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative--did help spur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off disinflationary pressures.4 Other central banks also deployed unconventional policy tools in the years that followed the financial crisis.5 Evidence accumulated from their experience also supports the notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after their short-term interest rates were lowered to near-zero--and, in some cases, even below zero.6 Meeting the Challenge of Scaling Back AccommodationBy 2014, the U.S. economy was making notable progress toward the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability. On net, longer-term yields may be little affected by this hypothetical scenario: While the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term premiums and hold longer-term yields lower, the expected faster pace of short-term interest rate increases would push longer-term yields higher.16 A Key Question for the FutureAs the financial crisis and Great Recession fade into the past and the stance of monetary policy gradually returns to normal, a natural question concerns the possible future role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis. As a result of the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years: One, the FOMC had to provide additional policy accommodation after short-term interest rates reached their effective lower bound; and two, subsequently, as we made progress toward the achievement of our mandate, we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the presence of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.\n",

      " As one recent commentator put it, work such as Douglas's was part of \"a growing literature , , , [that] played an important role in shaping the approach to combining statistical methods and economic theory that would become the standard econometric practice in the later decades of the 20th century. One of Paul Douglas's most important achievements in public life was to promote ethics in government. He was raised with a strong sense of right and wrong and was heavily influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to believe that ethical behavior was also an eminently practical approach to life. As a college professor, he entered public life in Chicago in the 1920s somewhat reluctantly to fight the spectacular political and commercial corruption that was strangling the city. Once elected to office, he faced the challenge of how to act ethically when corruption was so universal that the city's aldermen were expected to funnel large sums to their constituents, based on the presumption that all politicians were \"on the take.\" If he refused bribes and then had no money to hand out, how would he convince people that he wasn't simply refusing to share? At first, the public, inured to corruption, either disbelieved him or thought him a sucker for refusing to take bribes. He strongly believed that these gift limits also made him more effective as a public servant, and he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the widespread requirement of financial disclosure and limits on accepting gifts.\n",

      "  The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is motivated by the dual mandate, which calls upon us to achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. Yet, since Chairman Bernanke first discussed the end of the asset purchase program in mid-2013, volatility has surprised both on the upside (the \"taper tantrum\") and on the downside (the actual taper and the low volatility throughout most of 2014). And, of course, a strong U.S. economy contributes to strong growth around the globe, particularly in the emerging market economies (EMEs). Recent research by Board staff, using a database of loans primarily to U.S. borrowers but also to some foreign borrowers, suggests that lenders have indeed originated an increased number of risky syndicated loans post-crisis, based on the assessed probability of default as reported to bank supervisors (figure 1).3 Regression results confirm that the average probability of default is significantly inversely related to U.S. long-term interest rates. These data suggest that a tougher regulatory environment may have made U.S.-based bank originators unable or unwilling to hold risky loans on their balance sheets. The role of low interest rates in advanced economies in encouraging capital flows to EMEs where returns are higher has been a familiar theme.4 And recent studies have found that asset prices in EMEs do respond systematically to U.S. monetary policy shocks.5 For evidence of increased risk-taking in cross-border investment, let's look at the composition of U.S. investors' foreign bond portfolios.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The paper argues that rising fiscal pressures, exacerbated by Federal Reserve losses on asset sales and low remittances to the Treasury, could lead the Federal Reserve to delay balance sheet normalization and to fail to remove monetary accommodation as needed to keep inflation expectations stable and inflation in check. In that case, the market could perceive the onset of fiscal dominance, thus setting off a vicious cycle of rising inflation expectations, increasing interest rates, and ever greater fiscal unsustainability. The Great Recession has generated a third substantial increase in federal debt, from about 35 percent of GDP in 2007 to around 75 percent at the end of this fiscal year, an increase that is consistent with other increases in sovereign debt for advanced economies after severe financial crises during the post-World War II period.5 History and common sense suggest that the federal government should again run primary surpluses sufficient over time to reduce debt to pre-crisis levels of perhaps 35 to 40 percent of GDP. Under the reasonable projection mentioned above, the debt-to-GDP ratio will remain roughly stable until 2020 before rising significantly in the next decade.8 That's not a favorable longer-term forecast, all the more so because it is importantly the result of demographic changes that have been expected for decades. Moreover, any temporary losses should be weighed against the expected social benefits of the increased economic growth generated by the LSAPs, which would include higher tax revenue from increased output.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " In the meantime, some urge the adoption of more intrusive reforms, such as a return to Glass-Steagall-style activity limits, more stringent limits on size or systemic footprint, or a requirement that the largest institutions break up into much smaller pieces. That included the failure of the Bank of New England Corp., then the third largest bank failure in U.S. history.2   It happened in January 1991, at a time of great stress in the financial system and the broader economy, and only days after 45 depository institutions in the region had been closed and 300,000 deposit accounts frozen.3   My Treasury colleagues and I joined representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Board in a conference room on a Sunday morning. In my view, losses at the commercial banks were more importantly a consequence of bad credit underwriting and the failure of risk management systems to keep up with innovation and the explosive growth in securitization--developments that were not fundamentally driven by the repeal of Glass-Steagall. This form of proposal would allow such a firm to continue to increase assets and diversify its activities to achieve potentially available economies of scale and scope, so long as the firm finances expansion through more stable forms of funding.10 Break-upSome critics want to get right to the business of breaking up the big banks into smaller, more manageable, more easily resolvable pieces.12   At the heart of this proposal is the thought that no financial institution should be so large or complex that it cannot be allowed to fail, like any other private business, with losses to its equity holders and creditors, and consequences for senior management.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " That modest pace is notably weaker than the experience of past recoveries would have predicted, even accounting for the depth and duration of the Great Recession.2 Since 2009, the question has been when the recovery will decisively take hold and begin to deliver the higher levels of growth that are needed to put people back to work more quickly. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1-1/2 percentage points this year.3 Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment. The longer workers are unemployed, the greater the likelihood that their skills will erode and workers will lose attachment to the labor force, permanently damaging the economy's dynamism and potential output. The Committee indicated its intention to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent, provided inflation one- to two-years ahead is projected to be no higher than 2.5 percent.4 And under the current flow-based LSAP program, adopted last year, we are purchasing $85 billion a month in long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). But low rates are not solely or even primarily a result of the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policies; they are rooted in the market's expectations of low inflation and the weakness of the economic recovery, factors weighing on rates not just in the United States but throughout the advanced economies.7 Given low real rates and low inflation, expected nominal returns should be low across all asset classes.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " This high level of federal government debt leaves U.S. policymakers with less \"fiscal space\" than may be required to deal with expected increases in retirement and health-care costs, or with unanticipated economic shocks. And although the unemployment rate has declined notably since its peak in 2010, it remains well above our estimate of a longer-run, more normal level. With these fiscal headwinds and the lingering effects of the recession, growth has remained in the range of 2 percent since 2009. One of the most important goals is to ensure that banks have adequate capital to withstand severe financial stress. The challenge is not so much to allow such institutions to fail, but rather to contain their failure so that it does not inflict enormous collateral damage on innocent bystanders and the broader economy. On that note, I will briefly discuss the Fed's proposal for oversight of foreign banks operating in the United States, which carries out a mandate from the Congress under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.2 Our proposal represents a targeted set of adjustments aimed at reducing the risks posed by the U.S. operations of large foreign banks to U.S. financial stability that were revealed during, and in the aftermath of, the recent financial crisis. We believe that our foreign bank proposal, which would increase the strength and resiliency of the U.S. operations of these firms, would meaningfully reduce the likelihood of disruptive ring-fencing at the moment of crisis that could undermine an SPOE resolution of a large foreign bank.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As time passed and labor market conditions improved, it would be important for the Committee to clarify the meaning of the term substantial improvement. And given the lack of precedent, it was likely that this transition to more-specific guidance would involve some short-run volatility. Despite strong, ongoing headwinds from fiscal policy, there has been significant progress in the labor market. The unemployment rate declined from 8.1 percent to 7.3 percent. \"2  In late May, the Chairman stated, in response to a question during a congressional hearing, that the Committee might begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases \"over the next few meetings. \"3  A few weeks later, at his press conference after the June 2013 FOMC meeting, the Chairman noted that the substantial improvement test might well be met over the coming year, and he therefore set forth a framework designed to clarify the path of purchases.4 Under the most recent articulation of that framework, in considering when to reduce purchases, the Committee will \"assess whether incoming information continues to support [its] expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. However, as the minutes of the September FOMC meeting reflect, there were legitimate concerns about the strength of incoming economic data, the economic effects of tighter financial conditions and of tighter fiscal policy, and the prospect for disruptive events on the fiscal front.7  I supported the decision as a reasonable exercise in risk management.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " To make matters worse, community bankers, who played no part in causing the financial crisis, have been forced to fight to ensure that they are not swept up in a torrent of costly new regulations that were intended to address problems at those very large banks that did contribute to the crisis. If any doubt remains about the importance of community banks to local economies, the Kandrac paper looks at the extreme situation in which a community bank fails, and documents the subsequent harm to local economic growth resulting from that failure. In particular, he finds that resolutions that include loss-sharing agreements tend to have smaller negative effects on local economic growth than resolutions that do not include such agreements; Kandrac attributes these differences to the greater harm done to banking relationships when there is no loss-sharing agreement. Given the success that community banks have enjoyed in lending to small businesses, this paper explores the possibility that these institutions could expand their involvement in business equipment leasing, a potential growth area that community banks might want to investigate. Shen and Hartarska estimate that community banks could improve their profitability and reduce their risk of default through increased use of derivatives. The Moore and Seamans results from their failure-prediction model contribute to this discussion by demonstrating that simple capital ratios do a good job of identifying those community banks with the greatest probability of failure, so that regulators need not unduly impede the actions of the great majority of community banks that are highly unlikely to fail.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The past several decades are replete with episodes of strong capital inflows being followed by abrupt reversals, all too often resulting in financial crisis and economic distress.2 Some of this volatility no doubt reflects the evolution of strengths and vulnerabilities within the EMEs themselves. As advanced economies pursued highly accommodative monetary policies and EMEs subsequently received strong capital inflows, reflecting investors' pursuit of higher returns, concerns were expressed that a flood of liquidity would overwhelm emerging markets, drive up asset prices to unsustainable levels, set off credit booms, and thus sow the seeds of future crises. In addition, the bounceback of the EMEs from the global financial crisis widened this differential even more, although the gap has diminished more recently as growth in the EMEs has slowed. For example, some studies indicate that an easing of U.S. monetary policy tends to lower volatility (as measured by the VIX), increase leverage of financial intermediaries, and boost EME capital inflows and currencies.10 A second point to bear in mind when assessing monetary policy spillovers is that expansionary policies in the advanced economies are not beggar-thy-neighbor; in other words, they do not undermine exports from EMEs. Nevertheless, in an environment of volatile global markets, regulators should guard against the buildup of vulnerabilities, such as excessive dependence on wholesale and external funding, declining asset quality, and foreign currency mismatches. It is notable that some central banks with stronger records on price stability have been able to avoid tightening whereas others have been forced to raise rates to defend price stability in the face of domestic weakness.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " And new rules to improve the functioning of markets, such as those that require greater transparency of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets through trade repositories and swap execution facilities, will strengthen financial institutions and infrastructures alike. Moreover, greater post-trade transparency will improve competition and make it easier for market participants to make informed choices about which OTC derivatives are best suited to their needs. In the absence of government intervention, AIG's failure would have exposed its counterparties to significant losses at a time of widespread financial stress. Further, the lack of transparency in OTC derivatives markets at that time led to a wave of uncertainty about who was exposed to AIG and the extent of that exposure. This fundamental lack of information fueled concerns about potential losses and drove a cycle of escalating pressure on large financial institutions around the globe. The hub-and-spoke structure of central clearing enables the netting of gains and losses across multiple market participants, which has the potential to significantly reduce each participant's aggregate counterparty risk exposure. The new Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, commonly referred to as the PFMIs, set a higher bar for risk management to strengthen these core market infrastructures and promote financial stability.6 Just last week, the CFTC finalized its adoption of the PFMIs for the derivatives clearing organizations it regulates and supervises.7 The PFMIs require that a CCP develop strategies to cover its losses and continue operating in a time of widespread financial stress.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " First, by increasing public understanding and market confidence in the path of rates, guidance has helped reduce term premiums. Second, by communicating that rates would remain lower for longer than market participants might otherwise have expected, guidance has lowered medium- and longer-term rates through the expectations channel. Event studies as well as market-implied quotes and surveys corroborate the view that guidance has reduced medium- and longer-term interest rates and has held down volatility as well. To be sure, there have also been times when forward guidance and market expectations have diverged, with resulting spikes in volatility. Such situations may be difficult to avoid, given the use of new, unconventional policy tools, although we always try to communicate policy as clearly as possible. \"1  In August 2011, the Committee moved to date-based guidance, saying that it expected to hold the rate near zero at least until mid-2013.2  In December 2012, the Committee adopted quantitative thresholds that were explicitly tied to future economic conditions. In particular, it stated its intention to hold the policy rate near zero \"at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In my view, the reasons would include the lingering effects of the financial crisis, including lower potential growth for a time.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " LIBOR is currently referenced in roughly $300 trillion worth of contracts globally, which means that it is part of the global financial system's critical infrastructure.1 But LIBOR's credibility was badly undermined by the scandal that erupted when some of the banks that help produce the rate attempted to manipulate it by contributing inaccurate estimates of their borrowing costs. But I believe that they are crucial to strengthening the stability of our financial system and to helping restore the public's faith in its integrity. Since 2012, seven financial institutions have settled related charges with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, and the cumulative penalties and fines paid in the United States now stand at more than $3 billion.8 Global penalties paid related to benchmark misconduct exceed $6 billion as investigations into reference rate manipulation continue. Although these penalties and fines are themselves substantial, to my mind the longer-term damage to the public's trust represents the greater cost of this misconduct. Changes in bank behavior following the crisis exacerbated the decline and further weakened the foundation of LIBOR. While it is also possible that activity in these markets could rebound, the threat that this form of borrowing may decline further, particularly in periods of stress, seems likely to remain. Encouraging alternatives that better reflect today's funding markets would also allow for greater choice, increase the resilience of the system, and would potentially make hedging of some risks less costly.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " While we have made significant progress in enlisting central clearing to reduce systemic risks, I will argue that there is a good deal more to do to ensure that the reforms achieve their potential and minimize the possibility of unintended and undesirable consequences.1 Prior to the crisis, the then highly opaque market for OTC derivatives grew at an astonishing and unsustainable pace of nearly 25 percent per annum in a context of relatively light regulation and bilateral clearing.2 With the benefit of hindsight, we know that along with this torrid growth came an unmeasured and underappreciated buildup of risk. The spectacular losses suffered by American International Group, Inc., or AIG, on its derivatives positions, and the resulting concerns about the potential effect of AIG's failure on its major derivatives counterparties, serve as particularly apt reminders of the wider failures and weaknesses that were revealed by the crisis. In the event of disorderly CCP failures, the netting benefits and other efficiencies that CCPs offer would be lost at a point when the financial system is already under significant stress. Recovery and resolutionI have focused so far on what we can do to ensure that CCPs do not fail: more transparency, enhanced stress testing, more robust capital and default waterfalls, stronger liquidity, and increased incentives to appropriately manage risks. It has been a challenge for some market participants to confront the fact that risks and losses, however well managed, do not simply disappear within a CCP but are ultimately allocated in some way to the various stakeholders in the organization--even if the risk of loss is quite remote.\n",

      "  Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about some of the key issues facing community banks. As the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board's community and regional bank subcommittee, I try to meet with groups of community bankers whenever I can to better understand what is on community bankers' minds. While today's webinar is no substitute for face-to-face meetings with bankers, it is a special treat to be able to leverage technology to speak to and hear from so many community bankers across the country at the same time. Community banks have strong links to the people and businesses in their communities, as well as direct knowledge of local economic conditions. These close ties give community bankers a clear advantage in understanding local needs and tailoring their products and services to meet those needs. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) of 1996 tasked financial regulators with reviewing regulations issued by the agencies at least every 10 years to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations. One of the themes that we hear in our interactions with community bankers is concern that the regulatory environment could be tailored more effectively for community banks, and the EGRPRA process gives all interested parties a voice in identifying areas where regulatory requirements may be disproportionate to risk. The Federal Reserve is committed to tailoring its supervisory practices as appropriate for community banks to reduce unnecessary burden, while still ensuring that community banks continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " I will confess that I have never worked at a community bank; however, I have been a community bank customer, and in that role I have had personal experience interacting with bankers whose mission is to provide high quality of service to every customer who walks in the door. Despite the advantages that I just mentioned, life is not always easy for community bankers. The number of community banks in the United States has declined sharply over the past three decades, due to a combination of failures and acquisitions.2 And many remaining community banks have struggled to survive, especially during the last five or six years. Although improving overall economic conditions have begun to provide some relief to these struggling banks, they continue to face significant challenges. The entire Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community banks, thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts.3 Individual governors also take advantage of opportunities to meet with community bankers from time to time. And, of course, this conference, which was conceived as the result of a successful collaboration between the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, provides an annual opportunity for community bankers, bank regulators, and academic researchers to come together to share ideas and insights surrounding the issues that matter most to community bankers. The response to the conference's call for papers was quite impressive, and the conference research committee faced the challenging task of selecting the most relevant, interesting, and high-quality papers to be included in the program.\n",

      " This paper argues that the extraordinary response to the global financial crisis brought about a conflict between debt management and monetary policy that should have been avoided through collaboration. The paper proposes a regime in which the Treasury and the Fed would cooperate around debt management at all times and would fully collaborate in the case in which the monetary policy rate is pinned at the zero lower bound. Maturity extension merely continued a policy begun by the Treasury well before the crisis and was also broadly consistent with the Treasury's past behavior at times of substantial increases in borrowing. As the authors acknowledge, there are good reasons to think that any term premium effect of the maturity extension must have been much smaller than the \"35 percent\" figure implies. There are other channels that would not be offset by maturity extension--in particular, a channel by which the Federal Reserve signals the strength of its commitment to achieving the dual mandate. By most estimates, the 10-year Treasury term premium was deeply negative from mid-2011 through mid-2013; it remains near zero today, far below normal pre-crisis levels. Given the very low level of rates over this period, it is not clear to me that a slightly more negative term premium would have produced materially different real economy results. Any active collaboration between debt management and monetary policy, even in a crisis, would risk calling into question that independence.\n",

      "  On behalf of the Federal Reserve System, I am pleased to be here at the second in a series of outreach meetings designed to hear your comments and suggestions about reducing regulatory burden on insured depository institutions. Creating balanced regulations that are effective and thoughtfully calibrated to avoid undue burden requires input from stakeholders. Outside of these meetings, we also look forward to receiving written comments in which you can elaborate on how to improve our regulations in more detail than we can cover in the time we have today. This is why one focus of the EGRPRA review is considering the potential burden imposed by our regulations on community banks and other small insured depository institutions, so that we may carefully consider whether our regulations are appropriately adjusted for smaller institutions. We think it's important to tailor rules whenever possible to clearly distinguish requirements for different portfolios of depository institutions and reduce unnecessary burden on community banks. Of course, tailoring regulations may be more challenging in some areas, such as rules that provide transparency and fairness in consumer transactions because those are standards that apply throughout the financial system. For example, in December of last year, Congress passed legislation--which was supported by the Federal Reserve Board--that would increase the consolidated asset limit for small bank holding companies from $500 million to $1 billion under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and that extends the same treatment to savings and loan holding companies of less than $1 billion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " It has been a little more than six years since the fall of 2008, when the peak of a severe financial crisis presented the very real threat of a second Great Depression. As I noted at the outset, due in part to the Fed's effective response to the crisis, the recovery in the United States has been stronger than that of other advanced economies, with more rapid job creation, lower unemployment, and faster growth. The Fed created a website and issued a monthly report to the Congress disclosing details on all loans, such as the quantity and quality of collateral posted by borrowers.13 The Significant Costs of Restrictions on the Fed's IndependenceAs I said at the outset, I believe these proposals under consideration by the Congress fail to anticipate the significant costs and risks of subjecting the Fed's conduct of monetary policy to political pressure and of limiting the ability of the Fed to execute its traditional role of keeping credit flowing to American households and businesses in a financial crisis. As recent U.S. history has shown, elected officials have often pushed for easier policies that serve short-term political interests, at the expense of higher inflation and damage to the long-term health and stability of the economy.14 After World War II and as recently as the early 1970s, political pressures likely influenced Federal Reserve decisionmaking in a way which helped cause excessive inflation and related bouts of economic weakness.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " Second, these institutions are for the first time becoming subject to rule-based liquidity regulation, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, and liquidity stress testing.2 These innovations are in part designed to address the firms' vulnerabilities to damaging runs on their short-term financing, runs that occurred repeatedly during the crisis and clearly increased its severity. Central clearing holds the promise of enhancing financial stability through the netting of counterparty risks, creating greater transparency, and applying stronger and more consistent risk-management practices. But this reform program will only succeed if CCPs, in which counterparty credit risks are concentrated, are strong enough to withstand severe but plausible stress scenarios, including, for example, the failure of multiple clearing members. I will consider three factors that are often discussed in considering the broader question of when and how to intervene in the credit markets to promote financial stability through institution-specific supervisory policy.14 First, do conditions present a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions at the core of the system?It hardly needs saying that we must to be alert to the buildup of risks in the credit markets that could undermine the safety, soundness, or solvency of the G-SIBs or the broader system. History shows that excesses that occur at the height of a credit boom can result in substantial losses not just to financial firms and market investors, but also to households and businesses, when that boom turns to bust.15 The question of whether to \"lean against\" the credit cycle through supervisory policy--and when, and with what tools--is a difficult one.16 An important threshold question is whether supervisors will be able to correctly and in a timely manner identify \"dangerous\" conditions in credit markets, without too many false positives and without unnecessarily limiting credit availability by interfering with market forces.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, figure 2 shows that the Congressional Budget Office has made a series of downward revisions to its estimates of potential output in recent years.7 This supply-side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in the capital stock.8 Long spells of unemployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more difficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those who do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out. The number of new business formations declines sharply, perhaps because of reduced credit availability, which may depress hiring, productivity, business innovation, and hence trend output.9 Corporate spending on research and development has also been strongly procyclical, which may have similar effects.10 Turning to the recent U.S. experience, many economists now estimate that substantially more than half of the shortfall in gross domestic product relative to its pre-crisis trend represents a reduction of potential output and not just a shortfall in demand.11 U.S. labor force damage likely accounts for some part of the shortfall.12 The greater part appears to have resulted from lower trend labor productivity due to reduced capital investment and \"multifactor productivity,\" which is often thought of as capturing the effects of technological innovation.13 The employment rebound suggests that strong measures--such as those the Fed took during and after the crisis--can prevent even sharp job losses from becoming permanent. There is considerable debate about how much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio and labor force participation has been due to the recession, how much of that decline is reversible, and, relatedly, how much of the decline would have occurred regardless in the absence of a recession.\n",

      " Community bankers benefit from local knowledge and relationships that often lead to more successful and efficient lending decisions. These advantages have enabled many community banks in the Second District and around the country to maintain or increase their local market shares while competing with larger regional and money center banks, and I expect that they will continue to do so. For starters, community banks have been challenged in some of your traditional product lines by competition from larger financial institutions that can achieve lower costs through economies of scale. The crisis showed that such a focus on individual institutions was inadequate to account for and contain the systemic threats posed by risks at larger, more complex institutions, and much of the improvement in oversight has been directed at systemic risk. The Board is committed to making sure that new supervisory standards do not trickle down to community banks when they may only be appropriate for larger institutions, whether they be systemically important institutions overseen by the Large Institution Supervision Coordination Committee, other large banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets, or regional banking organizations with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets.4 For example, the Board has made it clear that capital stress tests and other aspects of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review requirements do not apply to community banks, either explicitly or implicitly. We have also directed examiners to spend less time on those areas of consumer compliance where problems are uncommon, although we are ready to ramp up that scrutiny if we have concerns about practices at a particular institution.\n",

      " So, two years ago, the Fed published a consultation paper that sought public input on ways to make the U.S. payment system safer, more accessible, faster, and more efficient from end-to-end.2 As we evaluated the substantial volume of public comment in response to the paper, the Fed also conducted research; met with a wide set of stakeholders, including banks, merchants, technology companies, consumer organizations, and others; and worked to enhance our own payment services. More than 300 participants from a range of stakeholders signed up to be part of the faster payments task force, and more than 200 joined the secure payments task force. By the end of next year, the plan is for the faster payments task force, with input from the secure payments task force, to have laid out its detailed thinking on the most effective approaches for implementing faster payments in the United States. Technological innovations can provide substantial benefits to payment system efficiency and security in the long run, but they often introduce new, unanticipated risks. For example, although payments cards reduced the impact of a stolen wallet, they've also introduced new risks, like counterfeit card fraud. The task forces that were created as part of the Fed's payment system improvement effort bring together a wide range of payment system participants to sit at the drafting table to create a blueprint for a safer and more efficient payment system. One study found that more than 20 percent of security incidents could be attributed to insiders.4 Segregation of duties, background checks, and monitoring for anomalies help reduce the risk of insider threats.\n",

      " Some of the ideas that came out of that conference eventually led to changes in the way primary auctions were conducted, changes that I believe were beneficial to the efficiency and integrity of the Treasury market. Hard evidence on the level of liquidity in secondary Treasury markets is mixed, with some measures at or above pre-crisis levels and some suggesting a reduced ability to buy or sell large positions without material price effect--a reasonable definition of liquidity.3 It is also possible that liquidity may be more prone to disappearing at times of stress. But these same regulations have also materially lowered banks' probabilities of default and the chances of another financial crisis like the last one, which severely constrained liquidity and did so much damage to our economy. For example, some recent commentators propose frequent batch auctions as an alternative to the central limit order book, and argue that this would lead to greater market liquidity.9 Others have argued that current market structures may lead to greater volatility, and suggested possible alterations designed to improve the situation.10 To be clear, I am not embracing any particular one of these ideas. Between April and June of this year, interest rates on longer-dated German bunds rose sharply and amid considerable volatility on certain days, an event that observers coined the \"bund tantrum.\" On March 18, 2015, shortly after 4 p.m. EDT and two hours after the release of the March FOMC monetary policy statement, the euro rose over 3 percent against the dollar in a four-minute period and then reversed most of its gain over the next three minutes.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " As Bill just outlined, for the next two days, we will collectively address the most important questions facing the Treasury markets today.2 Are there significant problems in these markets that are not likely to self-correct? More specifically, is liquidity in broad decline, or more prone to sudden disappearance? However, we need to consider not just the average level of liquidity under normal trading conditions, but also the risk that liquidity may be more prone to disappearing at times when it is most needed, as it seemed to do on October 15. I would point to four important trends that have been driving the changing structure of these markets: first, advances in computerized trading and high-speed communications and the entry of new players using these technologies; second, the intensified prudential regulation and supervision of the systemically important banks that are the largest dealers; third, the banks' own re-evaluation of risk in the wake of the financial crisis; and fourth, the increasing importance of mutual funds and other asset managers. Ideas such as these make me wonder whether it might collectively be possible to come to a compromise in which more trading is done directly on the public market, if at the same time the public market rules were adjusted to emphasize greater liquidity provision, and particularly more stable liquidity provision, over speed. Since the crisis, reforms have supported greater use of clearing for a wide range of products, and I believe that greater clearing in Treasury repo markets could be beneficial.\n",

      " In addition to the potential netting benefits I mentioned earlier, a CCP typically performs three other beneficial economic functions: 1) a reduction in the potential cost of counterparty default coming from the orderly liquidation of a defaulting member's positions, 2) greater transparency and a reduction in operational risk from enhanced reporting requirements and standardization of data, and 3) the sharing of risk among members of the CCP through some mutualization of the costs of a counterparty's default. This could pose its own complications, however, as some of these institutions may be unwilling or legally unable to engage in the risk mutualization that exists in most clearing models.ConclusionDespite these challenges, it is worth noting that, in the right setting, central clearing can produce significant benefits, including reduced credit and liquidity risks; improved default management and reduced risk of fire sales; greater transparency; and improved risk management. In addition to the potential netting benefits I mentioned earlier, a CCP typically performs three other beneficial economic functions: 1) a reduction in the potential cost of counterparty default coming from the orderly liquidation of a defaulting member's positions, 2) greater transparency and a reduction in operational risk from enhanced reporting requirements and standardization of data, and 3) the sharing of risk among members of the CCP through some mutualization of the costs of a counterparty's default.

      " Participants on the PTF panel viewed their relative speed and efficiency as allowing them to provide tighter spreads and greater liquidity. For their part, dealers noted that they provide a key service in helping their customers execute larger trades, and defended their internal matching of customer trades as a natural search for trading efficiencies. Although buy-side participants tended to believe that they were not directly affected given the short duration of the price swings that day, some noted that more frequent episodes of high volatility could lead them to demand larger risk premiums. The real question is whether there are dynamics at play here that are likely to produce more episodes of sudden, outsized volatility without any obvious cause. Presenters at the academic sessions of the conference argued that the combination of a central limit order book and high speed trading can lead to higher liquidity risk and a race for speed. In the current structure, customer trades occur mainly off of public markets, except at times of market stress when dealers may be unable or unwilling to internalize them. That approach does not seem likely to provide good, stable liquidity in changing market conditions. One presenter at the conference outlined his idea that high frequency \"batch auctions\"--auctions held every millisecond or so rather than trading continuously--would increase market liquidity and limit the race for speed. There may be other adaptations to the current market structure that could provide greater or more stable liquidity. A good way to find out if there are better solutions would be to try some of these ideas, at least on a small scale.\n",

      " Time-based guidance may reduce the sensitivity of rates to incoming macroeconomic data, suppress volatility, encourage risk-taking and increased leverage, and threaten financial stability. That said, I am not convinced that this distinction has played a central role in determining the successes and challenges of FOMC communications in this remarkable era, or that it helps us improve in the future. The Committee instead adopted thresholds, saying that it did not intend to raise rates at least as long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent, inflation one to two years ahead was projected to be no higher than 2-1/2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored.7 The adoption of thresholds was a clear change to data-based guidance, as its principal sponsors had frequently urged.8 The point was not to provide additional stimulus at the time of adoption, but rather to allow market participants to adjust their expectations about future monetary policy in response to incoming data--exactly what the authors advocate.9 The Committee also used balance sheet policy through most of this period. That criticism may well overstate the importance of the Committee's communications; nonetheless, a number of FOMC participants have said that the Committee intends to be \"data driven\" and not fall into an excessively predictable, data-insensitive path. In the statement released after its October 2015 meeting, the Committee reemphasized data dependence and focused on the importance of incoming data for the Committee's decision \"at its next meeting,\" which led the market to increase its estimated probability of a December rate increase from 38 percent to 50 percent.14 The October and November non-farm payroll reports came in strong and above expectations, raising that probability by the time of the December meeting to about 90 percent.\n",

      " Moreover, stronger demand would be more consistent with an environment that remains quite supportive of growth, with low interest rates, low gasoline prices, solid real income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, healthy levels of business and household confidence, and continuing strong job creation. TFP is that part of productivity that is not explained by capital investment or labor quality; it is thought to be mainly a function of technological innovation.5 A broad decline in the dynamism in our economy may also be contributing to lower TFP.6 There is strong evidence that the slowdown in TFP growth in the United States preceded the financial crisis, particularly in sectors that produce or use information technologies.7 The range of opinions on the future path of productivity growth is wide, and the historical record provides ample grounds for humility.8 A middle-ground position that seems to underlie many current forecasts is that productivity is probably still being held down by cyclical factors and lingering effects of the crisis. The United States now stands at the low end of labor force participation for both men and women in this age group--above Italy, but well below Germany, France, and Spain.12 Lower potential growth would likely translate into lower estimates of the level of interest rates necessary to sustain stable prices and full employment. To sum up so far, estimates of long-run potential growth of the U.S. economy have dropped from about 3 percent to about 2 percent in the wake of the crisis, with much of the decline a function of slower productivity growth.\n",

      " Since then, the official sector has thought seriously about financial benchmarks, conducting a number of investigations into charges of manipulation, publishing the International Organization of Securities Commission's (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks and, through the Financial Stability Board (FSB), sponsoring major reform efforts of both interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks.2 The institutions represented on the ARRC have also had to think seriously about these issues as they have developed this interim report. Now, we need end users to begin to think more seriously about how they use benchmarks and the risks they are taking on by relying so heavily on a reference rate--in this case U.S. dollar LIBOR--that is less resilient than it needs to be. This calls into question whether LIBOR can ultimately satisfy IOSCO Principle 7 regarding data sufficiency, which requires that a benchmark be based on an active market. That basic fact poses the risk that LIBOR could eventually be forced to stop publication entirely. It could entail substantial losses and would create substantial uncertainty, potential legal challenges, and payments disruptions for the market participants that have relied on LIBOR. Simply put, this effort is something that needs to happen, and if the ARRC members, the official sector, and end users and other market participants all jointly coordinate in finalizing these plans, then a successful transition can be made with the least disruption to the market, leaving everyone in a better place.\n",

      " From 2008 through 2013, participation dropped sharply by 3 percentage points, but has remained about flat, on net, since late 2013 in a context of strong job growth and declining unemployment. Some of this decline probably represents lower risk of high inflation, or an elevated liquidity preference for much more heavily traded nominal Treasury securities, rather than expectations of lower inflation. A growing body of research shows that deep recessions accompanied by severe financial crises often leave behind permanent damage.4 One recent analysis suggests that in about one-third of such cases there is no permanent damage; one-third of the time there is a permanent reduction in the level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and one third of the time there is a reduction in both the level of potential output and in the growth rate.5 Unfortunately, many economies are currently in danger of falling into the third category, including the U.S. economy. This summer, many will be carrying Robert Gordon's massive The Rise and Fall of American Growth to the beach (or perhaps to the lake, here in the Midwest), which argues the pessimistic view.7 For balance, maybe bring along Brynjolfsson and McAfee's The Second Machine Age, which take a more optimistic view and is a great deal shorter.8 One factor that may contribute to low productivity growth is the notable decline in recent decades in measures of the dynamism of our economy.\n",

      " These large community banks had lower average levels of profitability than our largest banks prior to the recent recession, suffered worse losses in 2009, and have enjoyed lower levels of earnings since the crisis. Since 2009, profits for the smallest banks have increased slightly but remain below their levels of profitability prior to the recession and below the ROA levels for larger banks.5 Data on nonperforming loans (NPLs) show a mixed picture.6 A breakdown of community banks by size indicates that the ratio of NPLs to total loans peaked for every size category in 2010 (figure 8). In the past two years, NPLs on the balance sheets of the smallest banks have declined more slowly than for larger banks so that banks with less than $100 million in assets once again have the highest NPL ratio. Fourth, although the lack of entry may be due in part to increased regulatory burden, much of it can be explained by very low interest rates and a post-crisis expansion that has been slower than usual. I think the key question for policymakers is whether the recent acceleration in the rate of decline in the number of small banks is primarily a structural change attributable to increasing economies of scale--or, perhaps more accurately, diseconomies of very small scale--or whether recent efforts by the FDIC and others to encourage more chartering of new banks, combined with a return to higher interest rates and stronger economic growth, will mitigate the decline in numbers.\n",

      " This segment of the industry has been in a period of slow but steady consolidation for several decades now. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Reserve convened the private-sector Working Group on Government Securities Clearance and Settlement to recommend steps to mitigate risks to the financial system from a disruption to these services. That work led to the \"NewBank\" proposal.1 Although the proposal was ultimately put aside, NewBank would have been a dormant financial institution that could spring into action in the event of potential disruptions from an exit from this business by either of the clearing banks. The Federal Reserve has been working closely with the Department of the Treasury to ensure a smooth transition as JPMC prepares to exit. The timeline set for a gradual transition over the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations; however, if unexpected complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted. We have long recognized that any disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial stability, and have calibrated our supervisory expectations accordingly. The bank is therefore subject to heightened capital and liquidity requirements and a resolution process that explicitly requires planning to ensure the continuity of critical services even in the event of a default. The PFMIs also emphasize a strong governance role in support of financial stability and the interests of market functioning, and this has been a focus of our work with Bank of New York Mellon regarding the transition.\n",

      " In particular, as you can see from the middle two bars of slide 5, the slowdown in world investment growth--from about 4.5 percent growth before the Global Financial Crisis to only about 3 percent growth since 2011--has been more pronounced than the slowdown in world GDP growth or in world consumption. Another manifestation can be seen in slide 9, which shows the decline in the share of parts and components in China's total manufactured imports from about 65 percent in 2005 to under 50 percent in 2014.10 These two pieces of evidence suggest that the shift away from parts and components in Chinese imports is not just due to lower orders tied to weak import demand in the advanced economies, but also due to the rising productivity and sophistication of the Chinese labor force, which is enabling China to move to higher value-added exports. There is little doubt that for many years China and other emerging Asian economies have benefited from rapid expansion of trade.13 Greater trade can provide a host of economic benefits, including enabling the pursuit of comparative advantage, fostering more competition (which leads to more efficiency), generating technological and knowledge spillovers, and facilitating import of key capital goods. I would argue that, instead of trying to restore growth through enhancing external surpluses, under the circumstances it makes more sense for emerging Asia to focus on domestic demand as an engine of its growth, and to allow their trade and current account surpluses to shrink.\n",

      " Despite these strong job gains, the unemployment rate has flattened out this year after several years of sharp declines, thanks to welcome developments in labor force participation (figure 3). When people enter or reenter the labor force and begin to search for a job, that is generally a good thing even though at the margin their entry tends to increase the unemployment rate (or prevent it from declining). The sharp drop raised fears that the crisis might leave behind permanent damage to our labor force. Even though GDP growth has been slow, job gains during this recovery have been stronger than those during the previous expansion--the so-called jobless recovery of the early 2000s. The combination of weak growth and strong hiring in this expansion implies small increases in output per hour, or productivity. I expect that the economy will continue on its path of the last few years, with real GDP growth of about 2 percent, strong job gains, a tightening labor market, and inflation moving up toward our 2 percent objective. This long-expected demographic fact has now arrived, and it has challenging implications for our potential growth and also for our fiscal policy.4 The unexpected part of the growth slowdown reflects weak productivity growth rather than lower labor supply. Increased spending on public infrastructure may raise private-sector productivity over time, particularly with the growth of the stock of public infrastructure near an all-time low.7 Greater support for public and private research and development, and policies that improve product and labor market dynamism may also be fruitful.8 Monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable expansion in a context of price stability.\n",

      " Questions of how much to say about the likely path of policy were extensively debated in the public sphere in the years leading up to the Bernanke era, and by the FOMC while Ben was Chairman.8 The benefits of greater transparency are typically thought to include more efficient pricing of financial assets and a closer alignment between the market's views and those of the Committee.9 Transparency should allow asset prices to respond immediately to incoming economic data, which would foster progress toward the Committee's objectives. Since the beginning of 2012, participants' views about the longer-run annual growth potential of the economy have dropped from 2.45 percent to 1.85 percent (figure 4).15 Much of the downward revision in estimates of longer-run potential growth reflects the implications of demographic trends and the slowdown in productivity growth.16 These structural factors have also weighed on participants' assessments of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate--the rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential.17 The median assessment of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate declined from 4.25 percent in 2012 to 2.90 percent in September of this year, with 60 basis points of that shift occurring just since September 2015 (figure 5). The persistence of low inflation despite faster-than-expected reductions in unemployment has also led participants to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate; the median estimate has declined from 5.60 percent in January 2012 to 4.85 percent in September 2016 (figure 6).\n",

      " That misconduct has been, and will continue to be, addressed through substantial fines and criminal prosecution of the firms and individuals involved. In response, many firms have changed their compensation practices since the crisis to better align incentives between individuals and firms, particularly through enhanced deferral of incentive compensation, with delayed vesting and the possibility of more robust forfeiture in a broader set of circumstances. As the Review notes, greater transparency can also help curb market abuses and strengthen competition. But despite significant progress, there are still a number of impediments to sharing trade report data across regulatory agencies and jurisdictions, leaving us with only a piecemeal picture of the overall market rather than the full transparency that we desire. The recent Financial Stability Board (FSB) report on foreign exchange benchmarks2 made a number of recommendations designed to address these issues in this specific market, including use of trading platforms to maximize the netting of fixing orders, encouraging dealers to charge a transparent bid-asked spread or other fee to compensate them for the risk they take, and strengthening dealers' internal systems and controls to better manage potential conflicts of interest. The challenge is to identify and preserve the legitimate benefits of such communication and trading while safeguarding against improper uses of information. If the publication of LIBOR were to become untenable because the number of transactions that underlie it declined further, then untangling the outstanding LIBOR contracts would entail a legal mess that could endanger our financial stability.\n",

      " Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail. Low Rates Can Mean Tradeoffs So far, I have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought us very close to full employment and 2 percent inflation; that forces other than monetary policy have been pushing rates lower for more than 30 years; and that the core of the financial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis. Low-for-long interest rates can have adverse effects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels, as listed on the next slide.8 After all, low interest rates are intended to encourage some risk-taking.9The question is whether low rates have encouraged excessive risk-taking through the buildup of leverage or unsustainably high asset prices or through misallocation of capital.\n",

      " While the pace of progress has at times been frustratingly slow, this outcome is a better one than that achieved by most other advanced economies. Take the concept of \"maximum employment,\" which requires an estimate of both the natural rate of unemployment for those who are in the labor force and the sustainable level of labor force participation.3 The natural rate of unemployment is not directly observed, and the record suggests that it could be materially lower or higher than current estimates.4 There is also uncertainty about the underlying trend level of labor force participation. One of the surprising features of this expansion has been that 2 percent growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has been enough to create solid job gains and unexpectedly large declines in unemployment. Much of the decline is due to significantly lower long-term expectations of inflation, as well as reduced term premiums, likely reflecting both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with anchored inflation expectations, nominal bonds have become an attractive hedge against market risk. Figure 7 shows the prescriptions of three simple policy rules since 2000.22 While the rules often diverged, all of them called for a substantial reduction in the federal funds rate around the time of the financial crisis, and all of them prescribed easing well below the effective lower bound (ELB).23 Faced with the impossibility of providing more accommodation at the ELB through deeply negative policy rates, the Committee turned instead to two unconventional monetary policy tools--large-scale securities purchases and forward guidance.\n",

      " Overall, the payments system must be innovative, while also addressing risks, supporting financial stability, and maintaining public confidence. The broad emergence of real-time systems throughout the world reflects the growing demand for such systems, and the need for the payments system to keep up with evolving technology.2 In the United States, our traditional bank-centric payments system, sometimes operating on decades-old infrastructure, has adjusted slowly to the evolving demands for greater speed and safety. The Federal Reserve has often helped address problems of this nature by convening stakeholders in the payments system and encouraging them to identify key issues and to work together to make fundamental improvements. I spoke about the payments security initiative on another occasion.3 The Secure Payments Task Force has been advancing important work, including outlining ways for the industry to improve payment identity management practices, crafting guidance on standardizing fraud and risk data, and developing a framework for protecting sensitive payment data. The role of the task force is not to select one or more proposals for implementation, but rather to assess the proposals against the task force criteria. Central banks could face difficult trade-offs between strengthening security and enabling illegal activity. To the extent we relax strong cryptography to make it easier for authorities to monitor illegal activity, we could simultaneously weaken security. Central banks would have to maintain records of digital currency issuance and might need to maintain records of individual transactions in order to authenticate those transactions and to combat cyber risks and illegal activity.\n",

      " The structure of the Federal Reserve was designed to achieve this broad representation and promote a stronger financial system to build resiliency against the sort of periodic financial crises that had repeatedly damaged the country in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Like a drumbeat, the country experienced one serious financial crisis after another, with major crises in 1839, 1857, 1873, 1893, and finally in 1907.6 These panics paralyzed the financial system and led to deep and extended contractions in the economy. The financial system came under severe stress when the demand for liquidity surged.7 A financial system strained in such a manner is like dry kindling in danger of being exposed to a spark. The final catalyst leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve was the severe Panic of 1907, which caused inflation-adjusted gross national product to decline by 12 percent, more than two times the decline recorded during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.9 After the panic ended, there was a broad sense that reform was needed, although consensus on the exact nature of that reform was elusive. Congress has assigned the FOMC the task of achieving stable prices and maximum employment; however, policymakers may disagree on the best way to achieve those goals.19 The System's structure encourages exploration of a diverse range of views and promotes a healthy policy debate.20 In the modern Federal Reserve System, each Reserve Bank has an independent research department, with its own external publications. Other scholars focus on business cycle downturns as creating conditions favorable to financial crises, as depositors viewed the downturns as affecting the solvency prospects of their banks, leading to withdrawals and panics.\n",

My colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and I are especially honored to be hosting you in Los Angeles. However, because the largest concentration of minority banks is located here in Southern California, it seemed natural to bring this conference west. Both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation share our goal of preserving and promoting MDIs because you are critical institutions to the communities you serve and the larger U.S. economy. First, half of our monetary policy mandate is maximum sustainable employment. That means that we need to be aware of employment trends across all communities in America, not just the top-line averages, since unemployment rates vary significantly across races and geographies. For the first time, last year, we put into our Monetary Policy Report to Congress a section that detailed how post-recession economic gains have been distributed across races.1 You, as MDIs, are committed to understanding and serving these diverse communities. I thank you for that work, and we will continue to work closely with you to better understand the employment dynamics of underserved and minority communities. Third, we have a great deal of expertise in community banks, which I know most of you are. We want to work with you to better understand those issues and to help you, where possible, to better serve your communities.\n",

      " The fact that we had a severe recession but not another depression is a tribute to the aggressive response of those who were in a position to act at that time.2 In the event, the financial system avoided collapse but incurred severe damage and proved incapable, for a time, of performing its key functions. Although job growth has been strong, gross domestic product has increased only about 2 percent annually since the crisis, held down by the weakest sustained period of labor productivity growth since World War II. The slowdown has been associated with weak investment and a decline in output gains from technological innovation. And about 75 percent of interest rate and credit default swaps are now centrally cleared, which allows for greater transparency and more consistent risk management.6 While the move to central clearing has made the system safer, we need to make sure that the central counterparties have the resources and risk-management practices to withstand plausible but severe shocks.7 Many of the statutory provisions and regulations put in place to effect these changes were novel; it is not likely that we would have gotten everything exactly right on the first attempt. For example, we need to allow boards of directors and management to spend a smaller portion of their time on technical compliance exercises and more time focusing on the activities that support sustainable economic growth. I support adjustments designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulation without sacrificing safety and soundness or undermining macroprudential goals.\n",

      " In April, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent, a level not reached since May 2007 and below most current estimates of the natural rate of unemployment (figure 1).1 Estimates of the natural rate are inherently uncertain, but other labor market measures are also near their pre-crisis levels, including a broader measure of labor market underutilization that includes those who would like to work but have not recently looked for a job and those working part time who want full-time work.2 The labor force participation rate, which had declined sharply after the crisis, has now been roughly stable for 3-1/2 years, which represents an improvement against its estimated downward trend (figure 2). For example, over the past three years, unit labor costs--that is, nominal wages adjusted for increases in productivity--have been generally rising a bit faster than prices.4 Turning to inflation, the FOMC interprets price stability to mean inflation of 2 percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5 This objective is symmetric, so the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below this target. Despite strong job gains, very weak productivity gains have led to disappointingly slow economic growth of only about 2 percent over the course of this expansion (figure 4). While monetary policy can contribute to growth by supporting a durable expansion in a context of price stability, it cannot reliably affect the long-run sustainable level of the economy's growth.6 The success of monetary policy should be judged by the economy's performance against our statutory mandates of price stability and maximum employment.\n",

      " Central clearing serves to address many of the weaknesses exposed during the crisis by fostering a reduction in risk exposures through multilateral netting and daily margin requirements as well as greater transparency through enhanced reporting requirements. A CCP faces market or credit risk only in the event that one of its members defaults and its required initial margin or other pre-funded financial resources are insufficient to cover any adverse price swings that occur during the period between the time of default and the time that the CCP is able to liquidate the defaulting party's positions. They may face draws on committed sources of liquidity, and if there are market stresses around the default, which seems a near certainty, they may at the same time face a sudden increase in intraday margin calls and their own internal demands for more liquid resources.9 These are risks that we should seek to understand better. For example, LCH has subsequently made changes to its intraday margining procedures in an effort to reduce liquidity pressures on its clearing members, allowing them to offset losses on their client accounts with gains on the house account.12 Other CCPs are also actively engaged in efforts to increase their efficiency.FICC is looking at potential solutions using distributed ledger technology to clear both legs of overnight repo trades, which could allow for greater netting opportunities and thereby reduce potential liquidity needs.13 Several CCPs are also looking at ways to expand central clearing to directly include more buy-side firms, which could also offer greater netting opportunities.\n",

      " The banking industry, and the largest banking firms in particular, face far less liquidity risk than before the crisis. And progress in resolution planning by the largest firms has reduced the threat that their failure would pose. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that financial crises can cause severe and lasting damage to the economy's productive capacity and growth potential. We have sought to accomplish this goal in significant part by reducing both the probability of failure of a large banking firm and the consequences of such a failure were it to occur. But in the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for large banking firms will produce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth. To accomplish that goal, it is essential that we protect the core elements of these reforms for our most systemic firms in capital and liquidity, stress testing and resolution. Third, the Federal Reserve is reassessing whether the Volcker rule implementing regulation most efficiently achieves its policy objectives, and we look forward to working with the other four Volcker rule agencies to find ways to improve that regulation. Fourth, we will continue to enhance the transparency of stress testing and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). We will soon seek public feedback concerning possible forms of enhanced disclosure, including a range of indicative loss rates predicted by the Federal Reserve's models for various loan and securities portfolios, and information about risk characteristics that contribute to the loss-estimate ranges. As we consider the progress that has been achieved in improving the resiliency and resolvability of our banking industry, it is important for us to look for ways to reduce unnecessary burden.\n",

      " While mortgage credit is widely available to most traditional mortgage borrowers, those with lower credit scores face significantly higher standards and lower credit availability than before the crisis. Under rigorous annual stress tests, they must demonstrate a high level of understanding of their risks and the ability to manage them, and must survive severely adverse economic scenarios with high levels of post-stress capital. It is extremely difficult to appropriately price the insurance of catastrophic risk--the risk of a severe, widespread housing crisis. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have successfully transferred some credit risk to the private sector, but have thus far avoided selling off much of this catastrophic credit risk, arguing that doing so is not economical.9 Principles for ReformAfter promising legislative initiatives have moved forward but fallen short of enactment, the air is again thick with housing finance reform proposals. FHFA's stress test results published in August 2016 found that under its severely adverse scenario the two GSEs could need to draw up to $125.8 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The overview differentiates between expected loss (credit losses that would be projected to occur even under a stable baseline), unexpected loss (losses that might occur under a stressful but plausible event such as recession) and catastrophic loss (losses beyond those of an unexpected loss and that are deemed highly unlikely to occur). The overview notes that \" catastrophic risk events are deemed so unlikely, meaning they present so little risk, that the Enterprises have found it to be too costly (not economical) to transfer much of this risk to the private sector,\" https://www.fhfa.gov/aboutus/reports/reportdocuments/crt-overview-8-21-2015.pdf.\n",

      " Our largest banking firms are without question much stronger than before the crisis. We are nearing completion of the major parts of this reform program, and are undertaking a thorough review to help assure that the reforms we put in place are both effective and efficient.2 During the crisis, some large banking firms incurred massive losses. Taking risk in service of clients is an essential part of the business of banking, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and various forms of operational risk. Our reforms were designed to assure that boards of directors understand and approve the strategy of the company and the risks inherent in that strategy, and that the institution has the capital, liquidity, and risk management capabilities necessary to manage those risks. Boards now more carefully evaluate the compensation practices of these large institutions to assure that they reinforce positive incentives and discourage unwanted risk taking. We do take seriously our obligation to assess whether our reforms are achieving their desired effects, without imposing unnecessary burden. A strong and effective board provides strategic leadership and oversight, which is much more challenging and important than checking off lists of assigned tasks. MRIAs are matters of significant importance and urgency that the Federal Reserve requires banking organizations to address immediately and include, for example, matters that have the potential to pose significant risk to the safety and soundness of the banking organization, matters that represent significant noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations and repeat criticisms that have escalated in importance due to insufficient attention or inaction by the banking organization.\n",

      " I know that they take that responsibility seriously, and I encourage all of the market participants here today to take the TMPG's recommendations just as seriously and to adopt them as best practices that will enhance the market's functioning. I first encountered Treasury markets in a serious way 25 years ago, when I served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Finance under President George H. W. Bush. As it became clear that Salomon's senior management had known about the issue for several months without alerting regulators, the scandal threatened to bring down one of the largest financial firms of that time. This event takes up a chapter in Buffett's biography, The Snowball, and it is a good illustration of why we need the TMPG. This last role has become all the more critical in recent years as regulations have required banks to hold larger amounts of high-quality liquid assets so that they can safely meet their potential liquidity needs. It was important to make the auction system more robust to potential manipulation, and we made several recommendations to do so and to open up the process to greater competition. However, in other areas that already worked well, we chose, for example, to open up issuance of securities that were in short supply (or \"squeezed\") when needed rather than to risk negatively affecting the functioning of Treasury markets by instituting more invasive regulation.\n",

      " Lately, however, the streak of weak growth in the EMEs appears to have been broken: The downward trend in Chinese growth has flattened, growth in other EMEs has picked up some, and Brazil seems to be moving into recovery mode. As for the recent rebound in flows, over the past year the model's predicted net inflows (the dashed line) have actually been significantly above actual net inflows (the solid line), suggesting that there is some room for flows to increase further without raising concerns. The growth differential is not playing a major role because the rise in EME growth has been accompanied by a rise in advanced-economy growth.5 Risks to Emerging Market Economy Prospects from the Future Course of Monetary PolicySome observers have noted that the risk of a reversal of EME capital flows may become more pronounced as U.S. and global interest rates return to more normal levels. For example, Bowman and coauthors document in their study that a deterioration in a country's economic conditions significantly increases its vulnerability to adverse effects from changes in U.S. interest rates.6 A case in point is the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when rises in sovereign bond spreads were significantly greater in those EMEs with greater relative vulnerabilities. One way you can see this improvement is through an index of aggregate EME vulnerability (the black line in slide 6), which is based economic data on a variety of variables from 13 major economies.7 According to this index, EME vulnerabilities today stand well below those in the 1990s--a period during which financial crises in EMEs were much more prevalent.\n",

      " I will argue that, for policymakers as well as the private sector, the challenge is to embrace technology as a means of improving convenience and speed in the delivery of financial services, while also assuring the security and privacy necessary to sustain the public's trust. With this additional information, the bank would have a more complete picture of an applicant's day-to-day activity and overall financial capacity, and potentially a greater ability to provide credit to customers, including some who might have been otherwise denied a loan based on traditional data. These examples highlight that there is a balance that needs to be achieved in this innovative environment.2 On the one hand, new technologies have enabled banks and other firms to find different ways of meeting consumers' demand for speed and convenience. Policymakers and the financial industry must assure that enhanced convenience and speed in financial services do not undermine the safety, security, and reliability of those services. It was in this role that we issued a call to action asking stakeholders to come together in pursuit of a better payment system for the future--focusing on speed, security, efficiency, international payments, and collaboration.5 I believe a collaborative approach ensures that change is designed by those whose commitment and expertise are needed to improve the payment system. A diverse range of task force members rose to the challenge by submitting 16 proposals to be vetted against its criteria.7 These proposals represent a broad universe of creative and innovative ways to deliver faster payments by embracing technology.\n",

      "  It is both humbling and a great privilege to be standing here today.1 I am particularly honored by the trust and faith that the President has placed in me and by the Senate's quick action in confirming me. There is no greater honor than public service, as Randy, Lael and all of our colleagues here at the Fed would agree. Price stability means that businesses and households can make important decisions without concern for high or volatile inflation. We also have important responsibilities for the stability of the financial system and for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including our largest banks. Through regulation that is both effective and efficient, we seek to ensure that credit, which is vital for a healthy economy, will be available to families and businesses throughout the business cycle, so they can invest in a brighter future. Over the past 25 years, the Fed has been a leader among central banks in improving transparency. We will continue to pursue ways to improve transparency both in monetary policy and in regulation. Many millions of Americans were still suffering from the ravages of the crisis. Since then, monetary policy has continued to support a full recovery in labor markets and a return to our inflation target; we have made great progress in moving much closer to those statutory objectives. In addition, the financial system is incomparably stronger and safer, with much higher capital and liquidity, better risk management, and other improvements. But there is more to the story than successful leadership.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly arise in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed: These questions strike me as representing the two errors that the Committee is always seeking to avoid as expansions continue--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating. The unemployment rate over this period was generally well above the real-time natural rate, and contemporary documents reveal that policymakers were wary of pushing the unemployment rate even further above u* (figure 4, top panel).7 With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, except for a few years in the mid-1970s, the labor market was tight and contributing to inflation's rise (figure 4, lower panel). Sentiment was building on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising inflation.9 But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing the wonders of a \"new economy\" in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks. The first case is when attempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis or an extended period with interest rates at the effective lower bound.21 In such situations, the famous words \"We will do whatever it takes\" will likely be more effective than \"We will take cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.\"\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " And, of course, I will be happy to respond to questions. Unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans. Many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but we are doing all we can to keep the economy strong and moving forward. That is the best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed. Each time we meet, we face the same question: How can we set monetary policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation? For many years, this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago. These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans. In particular, we are holding the largest banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liquidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take. I am confident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad. We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " For example, the medians of the most recent projections from FOMC participants and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well as the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast, all have the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent through the end of 2020, with inflation staying very near 2 percent over the same period.1 From the standpoint of our dual mandate, this is a remarkably positive outlook. Since 1950, the U.S. economy has experienced periods of low, stable inflation and periods of very low unemployment, but never both for such an extended time as is seen in these forecasts.2 Standard economic thinking has long offered an explanation for this: If unemployment were to remain this low for this long, employers would be pushing up wages as they compete for scarce workers, and rising labor costs would feed into more‑rapid price inflation faced by consumers. In the late 1960s, unemployment remained at or below 4 percent for four years, and during that time inflation rose steadily from under 2 percent to almost 5 percent. The late 1990s episode of low unemployment saw wages rise faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise in inflation. To be clear, during the periods of rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, the FOMC was generally raising the federal funds rate, but with inflation rising, the real federal funds rate was rising much more slowly or even falling.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  The Federal Reserve's mission is to promote a strong economy and sound financial system; I am glad to say we have made a great deal of progress toward those goals. The steady decline in the unemployment rate is mirrored by the decline in financial hardship reported by respondents to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking over the past five years.1 Wage gains, increased household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence are supporting robust consumer spending. Since the crisis, we have also taken numerous steps to make the financial system safer and stronger, leaving it better equipped to support the financial needs of consumers and communities through good times and bad.2 Moreover, the economy faces a number of longer-term challenges.3 While there have been gains in the pace of wage growth recently, wages for lower-income workers have grown quite slowly over the past few decades. Productivity has picked up in recent months after several years of very slow growth, but it is not clear whether this is a trend that will be sustained. And a decades-long decline in economic mobility in the United States reflects the difficulty faced by lower-income Americans in moving up the economic ladder.4 The Fed's community development function plays a key role in helping us carry out our broad responsibilities. In addition to providing us with a richer, more nuanced understanding of current economic and financial conditions, the Federal Reserve's community development staff is deeply engaged in helping lower-income and underserved communities overcome their challenges and capitalize on their assets. The economy benefits when we successfully tap into the underutilized potential of more of our fellow Americans.5 4.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " A strong job market has encouraged more people to participate in the labor market, another positive development. For example, unemployment rates in some persistently poor rural counties remain much higher than the national figures. The annual average unemployment rate in 2017 exceeded 10 percent in 27 persistently poor rural counties, and the rate was 20 percent or more in 2 of those counties. Labor force participation has been particularly low for those with only a high school diploma or less.1 Research has also found that business formation and employment growth during the recovery have been concentrated in large urban areas.2 Data and research findings like these remind us that, despite positive trends in national data, the benefits of the ongoing economic expansion are still not reaching some communities. To address this problem, the Dallas Fed has explored the role of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in addressing the digital divide, the potential for technology to bridge the urban-rural divide in access to health care, and the critical importance of preparing workers for the digital economy.4 Third and last, community development staff at the Federal Reserve Board and several Reserve Banks have conducted research to better understand housing affordability challenges affecting rural communities nationwide, recognizing the importance of sufficient affordable housing to a community's economic vitality. In closing, while the economy is strong overall, we recognize that some communities have yet to feel the full benefits of the ongoing expansion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The crisis revealed that banks, especially the largest and most complex, faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought. At other times, when uncertainty around the outlook is unusually high, I dutifully write down what I see as the appropriate funds rate path in the most likely scenario, but I do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted, for what is \"most likely\" may not be particularly likely. Persistently weak inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to support the economy during a downturn. In the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation and sluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells by adopting a makeup strategy.9 The simplest version goes like this: If a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal, once the ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target. Part of the problem is that when the time comes to deliver the inflationary stimulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular--what is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14 Experience in the United States and around the world suggests that more frequent ELB episodes could prove quite costly in the future.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The work that you do to promote access to basic banking services, affordable housing, and entrepreneurship opportunities supports the Federal Reserve and other agencies that enforce fair lending laws. As you know all too well, the current strength of the overall economy masks the struggles many individuals and families face in lower-income urban and rural communities. Low- and moderate-income homeowners saw their wealth stripped away as home values dropped during the financial crisis and have not recovered as quickly or completely as others. Because home equity has been the main source of wealth among low- and moderate-income people, the crisis dealt a particularly severe blow to these households. Most Americans rely on home equity to send their children to college, invest in their own education and training, or start or grow a business. These aspirations are the basis upon which a strong economy is built. When lower-income individuals and families struggle, it harms their health and well-being and also weakens our economy. When people are connected to education, training, and other resources that help them secure good jobs and other opportunities, they are better prepared to care for themselves and their families and contribute to a strong economy. The Federal Reserve has an extensive community development function, related to our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), that promotes partnerships between banks and community organizations to address local community and economic development needs. To complement the work we do with the other regulators to write regulations and guidance implementing CRA, the Federal Reserve System's community development staff help banks understand and meet their responsibilities under the law.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "  The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to stress testing as a cornerstone of our bank supervisory and financial stability missions. Stress testing is perhaps the most successful supervisory innovation of the post-crisis era. But if stress tests are to continue to serve their critical function, they will need to evolve in the years ahead to keep pace with the ever-changing financial system, as they have since the first round of tests in 2009. A little more than 10 years ago, the United States and the world teetered on the brink of economic catastrophe. The announcement of forward-looking stress-testing results in May 2009 helped restore confidence and stabilize banks by providing a credible and independent picture of their finances.1 These original stress tests evolved into the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, program, which has served to institutionalize capital planning by firms, and supervision by the Fed, as a forward-looking endeavor. The stress tests of the future—5 and 10 years from now—will need to continue to ensure that banks remain able, even in a severe downturn, to provide the credit that households and businesses depend on. As financial institutions and the financial system evolve, stress testing will need to keep up. When the next episode of financial instability presents itself, it may do so in a messy and unexpected way. Banks will need to be ready not just for expected risks, but for unexpected ones.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " The third era confronts us with the question of how best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to \"stop and go\" stabilization policy, as monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their blunt but powerful tools.3 Beginning in the mid-1960s, \"stop and go\" policy gave way to \"too much go and not enough stop\"—not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures. But many believed that central bankers would find it difficult to ignore the temptation of short-term employment gains at the cost of higher inflation down the road.4 Era II, 1983 through 2009: the Great Moderation and Great RecessionAs the second era began, inflation was falling, and it continued to fall for about a decade (figure 2, panel C). In 1993, core inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, first fell below 2.5 percent, and has since remained in the narrow range of 0.9 percent to 2.5 percent.5 Greater success on price stability came with greater success on employment. Thus, this second era provided good reason for optimism about the Fed's ability to deliver stable inflation, but also raised a question about whether long expansions inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses. Hyman Minsky long argued that, as an expansion continues and memories of the previous downturn fade, financial risk management deteriorates and risks are increasingly underappreciated.13 This observation has spurred much discussion.\n",

      " It is a great pleasure to join you all this morning for the premiere of KUED's documentary Marriner Eccles: Father of the Modern Federal Reserve. It is also a great pleasure to be in Utah. More seriously, his legacy endures in much more than a name on a building and a portrait on a wall. In a speech delivered here in Utah in 1932, Marriner asked what was the purpose of an economic system if not to allow those willing and able to work the opportunity to do so, to \"guarantee to them sustenance for their families and protection against want and destitution. After World War II, he recognized, again presciently, that high inflation, not contraction, posed the principal threat to the U.S. economy. And, perhaps most importantly from my perspective as Fed Chair, he is responsible more than any other person for the fact that the United States today has an independent central bank—a central bank able to make decisions in the long-term best interest of the economy, without regard to the political pressures of the moment. During his years on the Fed Board, Marriner played a crucial role in two landmark accomplishments that established the modern Federal Reserve—the Banking Act of 1935, near the start of his tenure at the Fed, and the Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of 1951, at the end. He accepted on the condition that Roosevelt support a restructuring of the Fed, which had failed to counter the contraction gripping the nation's economy.\n",

      " Since then, remarkable advances in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production to levels higher than ever before.3 In 2018, the United States became the world's largest oil producer.4 Oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that this month, for the first time in many decades, the United States will be a net exporter of oil.5 As monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s. Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to more‑normal levels after a brief golden age.10 Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved. Many indicators show a historically strong labor market, with solid job gains, the unemployment rate at half-century lows, and rising prime-age labor force participation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      " But the wealth of middle-income families—savings, home equity, and other assets—has only recently surpassed levels seen before the Great Recession, and the wealth of people with lower incomes, while growing, has yet to fully recover.1 Fortunately, the outlook for further progress is good: Forecasters are generally predicting continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation near 2 percent. Then I will turn to two important opportunities for further gains from this expansion: maintaining a stable and reliable pace of 2 percent inflation and spreading the benefits of employment more widely. For example, in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the forecast for inflation is a bit lower, but the unemployment forecast is unchanged and the forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly unchanged.2 The key to the ongoing favorable outlook is household spending, which represents about 70 percent of the economy and continues to be strong, supported by the healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence. While weaker foreign growth does not necessarily translate into similar weakness here, it does hurt our exporters and presents a risk that the weakness may spread more broadly. The research literature suggests a variety of policies, beyond the scope of monetary policy, that could spur further progress by better preparing people to meet the challenges of technological innovation and global competition and by supporting and rewarding labor force participation.6 These policies could bring immense benefits both to the lives of workers and families directly affected and to the strength of the economy overall.\n",
