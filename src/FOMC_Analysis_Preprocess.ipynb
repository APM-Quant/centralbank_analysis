      "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.\n",

The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1‑1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.\n",

      "Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices\n",
      "Participants continued their discussion related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. At this meeting, the discussion focused on two topics: the potential interactions between monetary policy and financial stability and the potential use of inflation ranges around the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. The staff briefing on the first topic noted that in the current environment of low neutral rates, achieving the Committee's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability would require low policy rates frequently, regardless of the monetary policy strategy and tools chosen. Consequently, policy strategies and tools that help support a stronger economy and anchor inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Committee's objective in a low-neutral-rate environment can help promote financial stability. In addition, the staff reported that the available empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices and risk premiums tend to be modest relative to the historical fluctuations in those measures. However, there may be circumstances in which a persistently accommodative policy stance that is otherwise consistent with the dual-mandate goals may contribute to an increase in financial system vulnerabilities, including through increased borrowing, financial leverage, and valuation pressures. The staff noted that clear communications of the Committee's ongoing assessments of the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability could help avoid large interest rate surprises that could otherwise contribute to financial vulnerabilities. The briefing concluded with a short review of how other central banks have approached this issue, including the use of financial instability escape clauses to provide leeway for the central bank to deviate from its usual monetary policy strategy if financial vulnerabilities become significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "In their discussion of the effects that alternative monetary policy strategies and tools might have on financial stability, participants noted that macroeconomic stability and the achievement of the Committee's dual mandate depended on a stable financial system. An unstable financial system may amplify shocks to the economy and exacerbate increases in unemployment or drive inflation further away from the Committee's goal. With respect to the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability, some participants noted that evidence regarding the link between the policy stance and elevated financial vulnerabilities was limited, with a couple of participants further observing that there were not many episodes of persistently low interest rates. In addition, some past episodes of heightened financial vulnerabilities were associated with excessive risk-taking behavior that did not seem to be very responsive to typical changes in interest rates. A number of participants judged that, under some circumstances, low policy rates might help foster financial stability provided they are needed to support strong economic conditions and price stability. Some participants remarked, however, that keeping policy rates low to achieve both of the Committee's dual-mandate objectives may contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities, especially at times when the economy is at or above full employment, a development that could pose future risks to the economy and to the ability of the Committee to achieve its dual mandate.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants discussed how financial stability considerations should be incorporated in the conduct of monetary policy. They generally agreed that supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks. A few participants commented that this is especially the case when addressing risks associated with structural features such as the current low level of neutral interest rates. A number of participants noted that countercyclical macroprudential tools, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, could be used to address cyclical financial stability risks. However, various participants noted that while these tools could be deployed proactively to lean against the buildup of financial vulnerabilities, they have some limitations in the context of the U.S. financial system, where the few available tools are, for the most part, not designed to address vulnerabilities outside the banking sector. In addition, these tools are not within the authority of the Committee, and their use requires coordination with other prudential regulators. Recognizing these limitations, many participants remarked that the Committee should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks, particularly when those risks have important implications for the economic outlook and when macroprudential tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mitigating those risks. Nevertheless, many participants noted that the current knowledge of the interactions between the stance of monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities is too imprecise to warrant systematically adjusting monetary policy in response to the evolution of financial stability risks. As a result, monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for employment and inflation, and it should respond to financial stability risks only insofar as such risks significantly threaten the achievement of the Committee's mandate. Several participants observed that the monetary policy measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be quite large, and the resulting effects on employment and inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures. Some participants remarked that, because financial stability risks are a consideration for achieving the Committee's dual mandate, a clear communications strategy would be needed to convey the Committee's assessments of financial vulnerabilities and their potential implications for the monetary policy outlook. Several participants noted that a communications strategy could include the possible use of financial instability escape clauses to help explain the rationale for policy actions when a buildup of financial vulnerabilities poses risks to the achievement of the Committee's goals.\n",

      "The staff's briefing on considerations regarding the use of an inflation range focused on three different concepts of an inflation range. First, an uncertainty range could communicate the magnitude of the inherent variability of inflation that would still be consistent with achieving the Committee's symmetric inflation objective. Second, an operational range could signal that, under some conditions, the Committee would prefer inflation to be away from its longer-run objective for a time; such a range could potentially be used as part of a makeup policy strategy, including one based on average inflation targeting, or in other strategies aimed at offsetting the adverse effects of a binding effective lower bound on policy rates. Third, an indifference range could communicate that monetary policy would not respond to deviations of inflation within that range. The briefing also summarized the experiences of foreign central banks that use inflation ranges; these ranges were typically put in place many years ago, often in conjunction with adopting an inflation target. The staff highlighted the communications challenges that could arise if an inflation range were introduced at a time when inflation had been running below the central bank's objective for a number of years. In this environment, the introduction of a symmetric range around the point objective could be misinterpreted as a sign that the central bank was not concerned about inflation remaining below its stated goal, a situation that could lead to inflation expectations drifting down to the lower end of the range.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and costs of different types of inflation ranges. Most participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range around the 2 percent objective following an extended period of inflation mostly running somewhat below 2 percent could be misperceived as a signal that the Committee was comfortable with continued misses below its symmetric inflation objective. Many participants agreed that an uncertainty range could be misinterpreted as an indifference range and hence as a lack of commitment by the Committee to its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Some participants suggested that it was not clear that introducing a range would help much in achieving the Committee's inflation objective; they noted that introducing a range could make that objective less clear to the public. Instead of establishing a range, the Committee could continue to communicate that its inflation objective was symmetric around 2 percent. While inflation is inherently variable, the Committee then could emphasize its intention for inflation to be centered on the 2 percent objective. Nevertheless, in view of the inherent variability of inflation, several participants judged that there could be some benefit in communicating the inflation objective with a symmetric range around the point target. In addition, a few participants suggested that an inflation range could convey the uncertainty associated with the available array of inflation measures or that the Committee's communications could more explicitly reference other measures of inflation. Several participants also stated that employing an asymmetric operational range for a time—with 2 percent being at or near the lower end of that range—while still maintaining the longer-run target of 2 percent could help communicate that the Committee intended inflation to average 2 percent over time, which in turn could help keep longer-run inflation expectations at levels consistent with its objective.\n",

      "The SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. For most of the period, risk asset prices rose as market participants focused on a perceived reduction in downside risks to the economic outlook, favorable data on foreign economic activity, and expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation in the United States and other major economies. Some market participants suggested that the Federal Reserve's actions in the fourth quarter to maintain ample reserve levels might have contributed to some degree to the rise in equity and other risk asset prices. Over the final few days of the intermeeting period, financial markets responded to news of the spread of the coronavirus that started in China, which reportedly contributed to downward moves in Treasury yields and, to a lesser extent, U.S. equity prices. On balance, U.S. financial conditions became more accommodative over the intermeeting period, with equity prices rising notably.\n",

      "Despite signs of reduced risks to the outlook and of some stabilization in economic activity abroad, financial market participants' views on the likely course of U.S. monetary policy appeared to have changed little over the intermeeting period. Market-based indicators continued to point to expectations that the target range for the federal funds rate will be lowered by roughly 30 basis points this year. This was consistent with responses to the Open Market Desk's survey, which continued to indicate that, while market participants viewed no change this year in the target range as the most likely outcome, they placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target range over the year than on an increase. Market commentary attributed the stability in federal funds rate expectations despite the perceived reduction in downside risks partly to the Committee's communications; some market participants reportedly regarded those communications as signaling a relatively high bar for changes to the target range. In addition, results from the Desk's surveys suggested that, notwithstanding the abatement in some risks over recent months, many market participants continued to see risks to the economic outlook as skewed to the downside.\n",

The federal funds rate was stable over the year-end date and remained close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. Ongoing reserve management purchases of Treasury bills and the Desk's repurchase agreement (repo) operations kept aggregate reserves above the level that prevailed in early September, contributing to relatively calm money market conditions around year-end. Market participants cited funding from the additional longer-term repo operations spanning year-end and increased capacity in daily operations as helping to maintain stable conditions in short-term funding markets. In addition, market participants prepared earlier than usual for year-end, with borrowers increasing their term borrowing from private lenders and lenders apparently expanding their lending capacity.\n",

At the current pace of $60 billion per month, the staff's estimates suggested that after April of this year, the Desk's reserve management purchases will restore the permanent base of reserves to levels above those prevailing in early September 2019. Al­though reserves are projected to be above $1.5 trillion before April, a surge in the Treasury General Account balance during the April tax season is expected to briefly reduce reserve levels and, in the absence of repo operations, bring reserves down temporarily to around $1.5 trillion.\n",

However, the Desk would continue the gradual reduction and consolidation of its repo offerings ahead of April, with the plan of phasing out term repo operations after April. As part of this transition, the minimum bid rate on repo operations could be gradually lifted, and the Committee could consider whether there is a role for repo operations in the implementation framework.\n",

The manager noted that, al­though the pace of Treasury purchases would likely continue into the second quarter, the rate of expansion in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would moderate during the first half of 2020 as repo outstanding was gradually reduced.\n",

However, the rate of increase in payrolls in 2019 was slower than in 2018, whether or not one accounted for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' benchmark revision to payroll employment, which was scheduled for early February. The unemployment rate held steady at its 50‑year low of 3.5 percent in December, and the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio were unchanged as well. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion. Although persistent differentials between these rates remained, they have generally narrowed during the expansion.

In assessing vulnerabilities stemming from borrowing in the household and business sectors, the staff noted that, while the ratio of household debt to nominal GDP was fairly low, the ratio of business debt to nominal GDP was high by historical standards. At the same time, major financial institutions were viewed as resilient, in part because of high levels of capital at banks. Nonetheless, the staff noted that banks had announced that they intend to allow their capital ratios to decline closer to regulatory requirements over the medium term.

Data pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2019, particularly on imports, suggested output rose faster at the end of the year than was previously projected, and this faster pace seemed consistent with the solid employment gains in the fourth quarter. In addition, more supportive financial conditions and the anticipated effects of the phase-one trade deal between the United States and China pushed up the staff's GDP forecast for this year and next. All told, real GDP growth was projected to be about the same in 2020 as in 2019 and then to slow modestly in the coming years, partly because of a fading boost from fiscal policy. Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2020 and 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022. The unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further this year and to remain at that lower level through 2022; the unemployment rate was anticipated to be below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate throughout the forecast period.\n",

The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having diminished a bit further since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate. Important factors influencing this assessment were that foreign economic and geopolitical developments still seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production last year, as well as the recent weakness in imports, was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected.

A few participants expressed less confidence in this outlook for inflation and commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased, or pointed to downward pressures from global or technology-related factors that could continue to suppress inflation.

Participants observed that enactment of this plan had succeeded in replenishing reserve balances to levels at or above those prevailing in early September 2019 and in ensuring continued control of the federal funds rate. Many participants stressed that, as reserves approached durably ample levels, the need for sizable Treasury bill purchases and repo operations would diminish and that such operations could be gradually scaled back or phased out. Beyond that point, regular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate the trend growth in the Federal Reserve's liabilities and maintain an ample level of reserves.

We have anenvironment in which there is not very much support--certainly nonational support--for this kind of firming in monetary policy, as bestI can tell. But even besides that, going all the way out to the endof 1991 we have a 6-1/4 percent unemployment rate and then that slackcontinues into 1992. You don't indicate what the unemployment rate isin 1992. I presume it goes up another half point or three-quarters ofa point?\n",

      "\n",
      "MR. BOEHNE. But even after we have done all of that[firming], we have not done much more than keep inflation fromaccelerating, at least in terms of the numbers that you have. Thereis some deceleration, but inflation is still largely in the 4 to 5percent area that we have been talking about. Now, presumably, if youcarry this [forecast] out to '93, '94, and '95, you begin to get someresults. But to me that calls into question the whole logic behindthis approach that we can gradually squeeze inflation out, asdesirable as that goal is. Somehow this paragraph brought home (1)the difficulty of it, and (2) how unreasonable it may be even to thinkthat we can pursue something like this in the kind of world that welive in. I don't know if that's a question or a comment, but I guessI'd like you to disagree with me.5/15/90My second question has to do with this credit crunchphenomenon. We've all looked into it; we've put together theseanecdotal reports, and every report suggests that there's less of acredit crunch than is talked about popularly in the general press.I'm just wondering if you have any insights as to why we have thisdichotomy between what is said loosely and what we find when we try tozero in on the extent of it. It doesn't seem to be the same problemthat is often reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. PRELL. Well, on the latter question, I'll offer a littleanecdotal information on anecdotes. I'll repeat one conversation Ihad with Bill Dunkelberg, who conducts the survey for the NationalFederation of Independent Business. That survey has shown very mild,if any, changes in the credit picture for that constituency. Herelated to me that he had been contacted by The Wall Street Journalbefore they published their lead story on the credit crunch and he hadtold them that. If you look at that story, he wasn't quoted. Thereporter obviously thought it would be better to discuss the negativenews than what Dunkelberg's survey suggested. That isn't to say theDunkelberg survey is absolutely reliable. But I think one finds thatsort of bad news orientation in the press reports. One also needs tolook carefully at the geographic detail and the sectoral detail thatis being addressed. Everything we have seen suggests that in the realestate area, particularly the construction side of the market asopposed to permanent financing of residential real estate, there hasbeen a substantial change in the tenor of credit conditions. And Idon't see any conflict with the anecdotal information in that area.As for small businesses, the senior loan officers opinion survey doessuggest that there has been some tightening. It hasn't been justrecently; it has been going on for the last year or so perhaps. Andit's affecting small and medium size businesses, particularly in[unintelligible]. It isn't showing up in rates; it isn't showing upas businesses not having any access to credit, at least not in termsof figures [unintelligible] cut back existing customers; but it'sshowing up in the standards that are being applied and the collateralthat is being used. The question is: What does that all amount to inthe end? In terms of GNP we think that the only significant effectsare going to be in the construction area. We would have had a markedweakening anyway in that sector, particularly in the commercial area,because of the overbuilding.On the inflation front, I don't want to repeat the entirepresentation that we gave a few months ago, but this is basicallyconsistent with that. In fact, I'd say this could be regarded as arelatively favorable short-run sort of Phillips curve trade-off. Weare getting a lot of disinflation for what we perceive to be the gaprelative to the natural rate. It does presume that history is tellingus that we can get there gradually, but the effects are not linear.In a sense, you have to get sharp absolute declines in activity inorder to get these effects, but we can do it gradually over a periodof time. I don't think we have historical episodes to go back to andsay \"Yes, we had periods where the economy moved slowly, theunemployment rate was perhaps slightly above the full-employment rate,and we got a gradual diminution of the rate of inflation.\" But theevidence that exists suggests that we ought to be able to get someprogress over time. As I hinted here and said in my briefing, we'dlike people to perceive that it's headed in that direction and thatthe Fed is persisting--accepting whatever slack there is, presumably5/15/90leading to some rise in the unemployment rate to 6, 6-1/4 percent.Frankly, people thought that was looking pretty good coming from wherewe were. Maybe we will get to see some of that developing and thetradeoff will look better.\n",

Well, this is a complicated question, obviously.Part of the issue would be whether this was just a one-shot effort tohit the Gramm-Rudman target for this coming fiscal year or whether itwas something that would dramatically change the outlook for the nextseries of years and greatly change expectations. When you open upthat latter door you're somewhat at sea in terms of an econometricmodel. One can come up with rather interesting results with that,such as long-term rates going down appreciably in anticipation of lesspressure on credit markets throughout the coming years. But if thatopened the door to a great deal of investment activity and it happenedvery quickly, we could even in the extreme get a net increase inaggregate demand in the short run; and short rates might even have torise some in response to that to keep things on a desirable path.Falling short of that, if the Federal Reserve is accommodative interms of trying to hold real GNP close to the path it would otherwisehave been on, I think the fiscal shock has to be one that tends tolower interest rates. The degree would depend in part on how muchforward expectation there was and how much bond yields move as well asshort-term rates.\n",

Our measure of this shows a shade less restraintin the current fiscal year than it did previously and that's mainly areflection of our reading of the information on what occurs on the taxside. It does look like tax revenues are running a bit weaker than wehad anticipated. What seems to have come out of tax reform, reading alot into the 1989 experience, is that revenue falls a bit relative towhat we previously had anticipated in our forecast. So, we do have alittle less restraint but it's a marginal difference, although that's[unintelligible] factor. Looking back at the 1988-1989 experience,there are many things that are different; and one has to make verydifficult judgments about the timing of various effects.

An industry economist at a meeting Iattended recently said: \"Boy, these numbers look great; but my bossthinks these inventories are still too high.\" So, I think the target,in effect, is continuing to drift downward. That was one of thereasons why in the past year when we saw manufacturing inventory/salesratios essentially just level out we didn't move up [our forecast]very much.

Assuming you also have the data for manufacturing, ifyou make the adjustments to have some form of weighing toward importsand take them out or put final sales in or total imports in, theinventory/sales ratios are much lower [now] than they were on anhistorical basis. So, they are already pretty far down. But, as Mikesays, when you speak to purchasing managers they still have a way togo because they still think that there is significant improvement yet[to be achieved] in the quality of production.

      "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, it's not too often that anecdotaland statistical information seem to be pointing in the same direction,but in our case for the first time in over two years they arebeginning to match. In contrast to previous reports that I've beengiving, where District performance had been marked with some strongand some very weak sectors, there is now improvement and it's morebroadly based. District manufacturing continues to outperform thenation. We had increases in manufacturing employment in the fourthquarter of 1989 and the first quarter of 1990 while it was decliningnationally. In wholesale and retail trade, District employmentincreased at about a 4-1/2 percent rate in the first quarter.Employment in the services sector is still growing at a healthy rate,with particularly strong gains in the areas of finance, insurance, andreal estate. In the energy sector, all field activities continue toimprove; as for the long-term outlook, there is considerable optimismfor continued improvement. District construction activity has beenstrong recently, though it's likely to slow some from its current paceof nearly 10 percent. Recent rains have improved the outlook foragriculture except, of course, in those areas where we've had somevery, very severe flooding, which I'm sure you've seen on the news.Our bottom line is that we do appear to be coming out of whatwe call our great recession in the District, and the improvement andgrowth seem to be widespread. Also, I think it's becoming quiteevident that our economy is much more diversified. Having said that,I'm inclined to conclude that we may be getting away from thehistorical boom-bust type of activity that we've had. There may besome disappointment for those who are waiting for the next boom,having gone through the bust.

Mr. Chairman, we think that the more restrictivemonetary policy that the staff is projecting is going to be needed ifwe're going to generate greater projected disinflation as appropriate.What's striking and disappointing to us is that this assumed tighter5/15/90policy is expected to produce only a small improvement in theinflation outlook, at least through 1991, but a fairly substantialreduction in GNP next year. I think most of us would agree, andindeed this was an import of the excellent memorandum distributed tous sometime back, that there are different kinds of models on this:those that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking. Iassume that most of this is based on the MPS model. If you used onethat is more forward-looking, I think that would suggest a bettertradeoff, with more disinflation at a smaller cost. Of course, thestaff readily acknowledges this in saying that the assumed tightermonetary policy could yield a much bigger payoff if it increased ourcredibility. And that, of course, is a very important issue from thestandpoint of our policy decision later on. I don't think most of uswould be willing to argue in favor of a tighter policy if we thoughtthe payoff on inflation was going to be quite as small as what hasbeen projected in the Greenbook.My own feeling is that the payoff would be larger because Ithink people are becoming more and more forward looking. If we candemonstrate to the public that we really have a strong commitment to[reducing] inflation, then I think perhaps we could have much betterresults than the staff is projecting on the inflation side. Now, wewouldn't quarrel much with the staff's near-term projections for thesecond and third quarters. I would guess that the near-term risksmight be skewed a little toward the down side because I think therereally is something to this real estate credit crunch. We hear thisfrom too many places. We had an interesting statement by a majorregional developer who is a very astute man, I think. Hesaid that funding has virtually dried up; he cited one large city inthe country where only one out of eleven major real estate developerscan get any credit at all.

      "MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Twelfth Districteconomy remains pretty strong despite slower growth in recent months.Employment in the West grew 3.2 percent in the past year, which issomewhat slower than the kinds of growth rates in employment that wewere seeing in 1989 when they averaged 4.1 percent. All of thatslowing in growth can be attributed to the state of California.California's growth in recent months has been quite similar to that ofthe rest of the nation but the other states are doing extraordinarilywell. For example, if you look at the seven fastest growing states inthe nation, all seven of them were in the Twelfth District. Theoutlook for western agriculture is positive overall, although thissummer's harvest is unlikely to be as profitable as those in recentyears. Inventories of many agricultural products are higher than theywere a year ago and the acreage that has been planted in the West ishigh as well. Even drought-affected crops such as cotton and rice areonly going to be cut about 10 percent, so we'll see a large increasein output. At the same time, costs for some farm inputs are updramatically. In California we're in the fourth year of drought. Andin California that means you irrigate in a different way. Instead ofusing surface water, you go to well water or ground water; and thatcosts a lot more money and is going to cut substantially into theprofits of farmers. In a state like Idaho where they also use a lot-10-5/15/90of irrigation, they have a shortage of water and the difficulty thereis in obtaining irrigation pipe. Apparently, it costs three times asmuch this year--if you can get it--than it did last year. So, theagricultural situation really isn't that bad overall, but it's quitelikely that agriculture won't be quite as prosperous financially as itwas in the last year.I might note parenthetically on this issue of creditavailability to farmers and to small businesses that we had two banksgive us some very interesting observations, and I'd be interested ifothers ran into the same thing. One of the large banks said thatthere is a substantial restriction on credit to small businesses.Another banker said there were restrictions to agriculture, but hesaid it wasn't related at all to what has been happening with regardto regulators' views or associated types of events. He said it'srelated to environmental concerns. Banks, whenever they take overcollateral when there's a default on a loan, are then responsible forthe environmental consequences. So his bank, for example, which is alarge bank, was no longer making small business loans to any gasolinestations, dry cleaning establishments, or any farms which had in-ground gasoline or diesel tanks. And any time they were doing largeprojects they would have to send out an environmental appraiser aswell as a value appraiser. He said this was having a very significanteffect on lending. My understanding is that apparently this is such ahot button with the industry that there are a couple of Congressmenwho are now in the process of introducing legislation that willrectify this situation. It's a little different wrinkle that I hadn'theard before but apparently, at least among our bankers, it's verysignificant.Turning to the national economy, our outlook for the year1990 is very similar to that of the Greenbook. We do part a bit in1991, but it's a result of the difference in monetary policyassumptions. We don't have the federal funds rate rising as rapidly,and we get a result which actually is quite consistent with theGreenbook's results. With an increase in rates of about half of thatin the Greenbook we get growth in 1991 of 2 percent and, indeed, thereis no basic drop in the underlying inflation rate until 1992. Thankyou.\n",

      "MR. SYRON. No, it's New Hampshire, actually. The economy inthe region continues soft, although it's not in a steep decline.Employment fell about 1 percent in 1989. We expect it to fall byanother 1 percent in 1990 and we expect the unemployment rate region-wide to go north of 6 percent. These assumptions are based on a modelthat was run without incorporating a national model with as muchcredit tightening as the Greenbook has in it. Actually, it'sinteresting that by state, New Hampshire is by far the softest,-11-5/15/90followed by Massachusetts and then by Connecticut. The reason forthat, I think, is that construction has turned down so much.Construction [spending] region-wide has fallen about 10 percent, butit has fallen 25 percent in New Hampshire. This is really micro data,but with it being a very important industry in southern New Hampshireparticularly, and becoming almost an economic [unintelligible] in itsown right like a traditional manufacturing industry, that's a swingthat couldn't be avoided. There is a substantial real estate overhangin the District. Housing sales activity remains soft; housinginventory stays high. I think housing remains soft in part becausepeople are very unrealistic in pricing. We don't seem to be gettingreal price adjustments. Using the ultimate in anecdotal information--what I am doing myself, and I just sold a house--I think you can movehouses but you have to sell them for about 18 to 20 percent less thanthe price at the peak. And people just generally aren't willing to dothat. I think it's going to be slow to come back because we're atquite a regional disadvantage now in terms of wages in light of thevery strong growth that we had for some period of time. And,obviously, we have serious tax problems; they are worse inMassachusetts but there are tax problems in Connecticut as well assome in New Hampshire. To some extent, in a regional sense, there wasno one to take the punch bowl away and what happened was that theregion just got carried away.Going to the credit crunch issue, we think there is somethingthere but it's very specific to small-to-mid-size businesses and tothe construction area. It's hard to say that in the construction areait's because of tighter supervision [of lending institutions]; we hadother problems in that area. In the aggregate data a lot has beenmade of the System's preliminary data saying that lending in NewEngland is down 8 percent over last year.

All that gets thereduction down from about 7.9 percent to about 1 percent. So, creditis growing more slowly but no way near as slowly as the data indicate.Outside the computer area, where I think we have specific problems, alarge number of firms report that sales, while they haven't kept uptheir strength, are not off dramatically either, particularly in thenational market. Interestingly, our large [unintelligible]producers--and by that I mean firms such as Ratheon, General Electricand United Technologies--are anxious about the outlook and they areplanning for a slowdown; but given lead times, they haven't felt mucheffect on production. And they have had some success in convertingplants to other products. Interestingly, they find their exportbusiness and even import substitution are actually quite good. Forexample, United Technologies just became a preferred supplier for--Iguess we call them transplants--foreign-name plants producing modularsfor doors and different things like that. So, the export business isbecoming more important to us, both directly and indirectly. When wetalk to people around the District, we're finding that inventories arequite lean. Again, it's hard to sort out exactly, but they are quitelean at the retail level as well as at the manufacturing level.As far as the national economy goes, we're in substantialagreement with the Greenbook. We had thought perhaps that inventoriesmight affect us--that there was a chance for some breakout on the up5/15/90side in inventories because we think things are potentially a littlestronger. We're inclined to discount the retail sales report becauseof the noise and just see what happens when we get the next PCEreport. We're encouraged by the improvement in the PPI but it's stillobviously [unintelligible] with substantial problems of inflationfourth quarter to fourth quarter. In looking ahead--and this was aquestion I was going to ask but it was asked by Governor Angell amongothers--if we assume essentially no change in monetary policy, ourfeeling is that an already discouraging Greenbook inflation forecastwould be significantly worse with the prospect of being substantiallyworse. And in that context, we'd be concerned about laborcompensation given some of the [upward] creep we've already seen inthat area. This will be covered during our policy discussion, but ituntil we get into a situation where we really have to crunchsignificantly later on. I think it is true that credibility isimportant and can make it easier for us on the way down; but I'mstarting to become concerned about losing credibility with inflationcreeping up on us and our not having been able to change materiallythe direction of that. That will increase the cost of our ultimatelyhaving to deal with it, and I think we ultimately will have to dealwith it. This is a speech, and I guess I should omit that.\n",

      "MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, overall conditions in the Districtare pretty much unchanged from the last meeting. We seem to havestabilized at a level reasonably consistent with our outlook for thebalance of the year, namely sustained growth at, say, a 2-1/4 percentrate. I have a couple of specific comments. First, on the autosector, which Mike has covered: At this point it looks as if some ofthe uncertainties in the industry early in the year have beenclarified, with the very large unsold inventories having been workeddown now to I think reasonable levels, particularly for this time ofthe year. Production levels in the second quarter will be lower thanlast year by about 12 percent on average but significantly higher, ofcourse, than in the first quarter. And the early outlook for thethird quarter is that production levels will be higher than was thecase last year, but last year's third quarter was comparatively aquite weak quarter. I think there's a slight change in sentimentamong the auto dealers. They have gone from being very, very negativeto at least being cautious. But my understanding is that on anational basis some 50 percent of them are still losing money. Andclearly, it takes very big incentives to move cars at this point. Thesales outlook for the year--adding cars and light trucks together--I'mtold by the industry is about 14-1/2 million units. They think that'svery disappointing. But having said that, they think their trend lineis about 15 million units; so it seems to me that on a broaderprospective 14-1/2 million in sales is a pretty reasonable year. Amajor uncertainty, of course, is the labor negotiation coming up inthe fall. It is just far too early to tell how that's going to workout. It certainly does have the potential to have a big impact onproduction.The steel business seems to be reasonably good; productionlevels are in the 85 to 86 percent area. Sales of some steel productsare coming in at about 100 percent of capacity and backlogs have nowmoved up to 82 to 83 days. As a consequence, we are seeing some price-13-5/15/90increases in the steel business and, given these kinds of pressures,those increases are sticking. The expectation is that prices will goup about 5 percent on average next year. In construction,surprisingly, both commercial and residential numbers in the Districtcontinue to move ahead of the national numbers. But I think we'regoing to see a big change and that there will be some reduction.Clearly, there is a curtailment of credit for commercial projects.But everybody I talk to says it's simply a result of having had fartoo much money going into too many projects and it's going to take awhile for the absorption rate to dig into the vacancy rates. Whilethe construction numbers probably will be a little lower than was ourearly expectation, offsetting that is our expectation that theopportunity for exports for the year will be a little better than wemight have guessed. The level of the dollar has not been impedingsales and any reduction in the dollar along the lines that Samsuggested simply will add to a more positive outlook there.In the agricultural sector, I was really pleased to hear thatplanting conditions have been excellent. In fact, in Iowa a number ofpeople describe conditions as the best they've seen in a good manyyears. The corn crop is largely in; the soybean crop will go inwithin the next two weeks. These better conditions will be reflectedin a good increase in the demand for agricultural equipment. Industrysales of large tractors and combines are running significantly aheadof last year.On the inflation side, the outlook is certainly less clear;it's difficult to tell how the first-quarter aberrations are going towork out as we go along here. But we are still, I think, a bit moreoptimistic than Mike in that we see some improving trends in inflationas we get out toward the end of the year. Market pricing formanufactured products continues to be very, very competitive. There'sa lot of pressure [to hold down] price increases, given capacityadditions as well as foreign competition, [but] I think we're going tocontinue to see some price pressures. In the services sector, though,there are some increases that are more disturbing; that would be mostparticularly true in regard to health care. But on the wage side,basically increases seem to be continuing okay. One very unusualexample: I talked to somebody who negotiated a six-year contract withthe machinists union the other day, which provides for an annual costincrease of 2 percent and some unusual features. I think that's anindication that wage pressures continue to be pretty tight.On a national basis, we think that the outlook for growthcontinues to be positive. But certainly we're going to need to seesome improvement in the inflation rate. We continue to be optimistic,as I say, but pretty soon we're going to have to see that evidenced bybetter numbers on the inflation side.\n",

      "MR. FORRESTAL. Since our last meeting, Mr. Chairman, theeconomy in the Sixth District seems to be doing a little better. Forexample, the unemployment rate in March for all of the states combinedwas the lowest that we've had in 15 years. That was mainlyattributable to better performance in Alabama, Mississippi, andLouisiana, resulting from stronger agri-business as well as offshoreenergy exploration and development. We're also benefiting in the-14-5/15/90Southeast and particularly in Atlanta from job relocations, which aresignificant in some cases, to the area and to the city. Otherwise,the weaknesses and strengths in the District are pretty much the sameas in the country as a whole, and I won't repeat those. We have verylittle real evidence to contribute from the credit availability surveylast month to suggest that there were any major credit problems. ButI must say that the bankers in the District don't miss any opportunityto remind me about the problem that they're having. They indicatethat loan officers are increasingly reluctant to make commitments andto approve applications either because the bank has had, or isanticipating, an examination or because of the publicity. The datafor District banks do show some deceleration in loan growth, but Iwould repeat that we don't find evidence of any substantial problem.Business contacts, and this includes our directors, seem tome a little less concerned about a recession than earlier this year,but they are complaining that the deceleration in growth is placingthem under pressure within their own businesses. For the most partthey have not seen price pressures accelerating and from this pointthey don't see inflation as a problem. As I've said several timesbefore, many of the people that I talk to are not convinced thatthere's anything wrong with the current inflation rate, and thatcontinues to disturb me a little. And they are worried, too, aboutour reaction and what will happen if we seek to bring inflation downtoo aggressively.Turning to the national economy, we did not as usual assumeany policy change over the two-year time horizon, so our forecast isnot especially comparable to the one in the Greenbook. But as I lookat both of those forecasts, I think our forecast has a slightly morepositive and optimistic view about the underlying rate of inflation.Some of the unanticipated increase in consumer prices in the firstquarter we see as basically temporary and not so much of that iscarried forward in comparison to the Greenbook. So, we're continuingto forecast the CPI to turn out between 4 and 4-1/2 percent over thenext two years. Beyond that we see very little improvement andperhaps even a deterioration as we look past 1991; obviously, in theBoard staff's forecast that improvement occurs later on. I think theGreenbook has done a very good and very reasonable job of distributingthe weaknesses that result from a policy tightening.I'm anticipating our policy discussion to some extent, but Ithink that a case can be made for some policy tightening at themoment. One argument would be credibility to be sure. Anotherargument that has some appeal is that it probably will be increasinglydifficult to make a move later on this year. Having said that, Idon't think the timing is really right at the present time. There arestill enough pockets of weakness both nationally and regionally thatthe risk of a downturn could be fairly high. The April data suggestto me that there's a bit more weakness out there than is built intothese forecasts and other forecasts. The current concern about creditavailability adds to that concern. And finally, it seems to me thatwith the budget summit that is starting today, a tightening of policybefore this meeting is concluded might very well reduce the pressureson the negotiating parties to actually restrain the budget, meaningless would be done. So, to me the arguments are persuasive that weought not to move at the present time.-15-5/15/90\n",

There are distinct pockets of great weakness,although overall I think it's probably continuing to perform, as ithas for some time, a bit better than the national economy--whether youlook at the overall growth of nonfarm employment or at specificindustries that continue to perform very well, such as paper andforest products, mining, and tourism. There are some other surprisingbits of positive news that I'll just pass on. One is that majorretailers, at least in the District, continue to post very goodresults. And home sales in the Twin Cities in the first quarter wererunning 15 percent above last year's first quarter and that had been asteady number month-by-month. So, there have been some pretty goodnumbers there. Also, the extent of the drought in the District hasbeen narrowed as a consequence of some fairly heavy rains in March andgood reports not only of crop prospects but about capital spending inagriculture for this year.I might as well give you my two cents worth on the creditcrunch. We're certainly hearing a lot fewer and a lot lower volume ofconcerns from agriculture and small business than we were hearing afew years ago when the Farm Credit System was in distress and whenthere were serious problems in agriculture and so forth. That's whenwe heard a lot about it. I must say today, relative to that period,it's absolutely quiet for the most part out our way. A major nationaldeveloper that we're close to has reported difficulties--not his ownbut of competitors--in obtaining credit. In fact, he has reportedthat on a couple of deals where he was not the low bidder and did notget the contract initially the low bidder couldn't get financing so hewound up with the contract. In terms of economic activity, of course,there is no depressing effect. The project is going to get done; it'sjust a question of who is getting the credit.\n",

Our outlook is for modestgrowth, containment of pressures in the short run, and gradual long-term progress. But we wouldn't envision the kind of tightening that'simplied; in fact, I think it's much too early to tell. If you look atand reserve aggregates over the last couple of months, you have towonder whether there's a significant tightening going on already withthe funds rate at a constant level. Again, having said that, I thinka month or two is much too short a period of time to react to. Ingeneral I think we've been well served this year by not letting veryvolatile expectations whip us around. I think our \"steady-as-it-goes\"policy has been quite good.On a District basis, I would say we're growing modestlybetter than the national economy. Even without auto workers comingback, we've had growth in manufacturing jobs. On the agriculturalfront, the flooding in Arkansas has created some problems, although Idon't expect them to have national implications. I think some wheatcrops will be plowed under and some cotton, rice, and corn crops willbe late getting in. But basically at this stage, there hasn't been amajor impact. On the price front, I haven't picked up much commentaryabout the minimum wage [increase]. I did pick up some comments inArkansas where firms have below minimum wage employees; they arecomplaining about the compaction effect on their salary scales and thefact that it has a much broader implication in terms of their coststhan just on the people below minimum wage.

      "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the Tenth District,the economy continues to grow moderately slowly. Recent developmentshave been somewhat mixed. There has been a good deal of press givento the agricultural sector. The wheat crop, for example, has beenestimated by the Agriculture Department as being near double lastyear's crop. That optimism isn't totally shared by some of the wheatgrowers themselves, although we're within probably 30 days of harvestin much of the Tenth District area. It does look very good, and Ithink the farmers are pleased with it. It's a question of how itcomes out. We are always reminded that a wheat farmer has to lose hiscrop at least nine times; in other words, he's very pessimistic untilit's in the bin. They're still not prepared to say it's going to bedouble what it was last year. The outlook for farm income for 1990 isvery good not only because of the wheat but also other crops, so thelast two-year drought will not affect the 1990 crops yet to be plantedand harvested. On top of that, crop prices have firmed up recentlyand there's a good deal of excitement about red meat prices. Forexample, prices of cattle, including replacement cattle for the feedlots, are essentially at an all-time high. Inventories of the latterhave not been rebuilt; they were run down over the last three or fouryears. So, if you combine not only a good crop year together withlivestock prices, then the outlook for agriculture is very bright forour area. A somewhat damping effect is the rain that Bob talked aboutin Texas, which also has occurred through much of the Tenth District.That has restored the moisture level, but now farmers can't get thecrops in [the ground], so it's uncertain. With respect to energy,despite the weaker oil prices, the District rig count did increase inauto assembly [capacity] in the District and that [activity] has beenvery sluggish, as has been detailed around the table. In themanufacturing sector that's laid against a very brisk business inaircraft manufacturing. In residential construction, contracts fellslightly in March, but nonresidential contracts increased, whichdoesn't tell the same story that apparently is told elsewhere in thenation. We do still have a large overhang of commercial properties incities such as Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa. But District-wide,the nonresidential commercial contracts have increased recently.With regard to the national economy, I have little or noquarrel with the Greenbook forecast. We go through an exercise inwhich we hold monetary policy steady as it has been going into ameeting such as this. Then, after we receive the information withrespect to how the staff has treated monetary policy in the Greenbook,we do another exercise and lay them side-to-side. This time they comeout fairly close, with the exception that we have a little less growthin 1990. That may reflect your pattern of increased interest rates;that isn't clear to us, I guess, when we get your information. But onthat we don't quarrel. We think there will be a little less growth in1990. The growth and the inflation aspects of 1991 look to be aboutthe same, given the staff's pattern of the interest rate levels.We have found little evidence of a credit crunch,particularly in the agricultural sector. The agricultural banks arevery liquid; they say they can't find the loans to absorb their liquidassets into loans. Where we do hear some evidence that credit is notavailable is in areas such as Denver that have just come off thebottom and where the larger banks have been hit and now have a ratingthat makes them very cautious about credit. I don't think it has-18-5/15/90anything to do with examiners coming in and knocking them. It'ssimply a fallout of what they've been through in the last year or two.They are on the way up but they're very cautious in their creditterms. It is not price as far as we can tell.\n",

We don't have a rise in short-terminterest rates anything like what is in Mike's forecast and theresults are about the same.On this credit crunch question, I've read all the surveys andlistened to all the comments around the table, and I still can't quiteshake a sense of uneasiness that there may be something there that wejust haven't seen yet. Of course, I have absolutely no evidence ofthat. But possibly, just possibly, the money supply, especially M3,dismiss it completely, but I can't quite bring myself to that.As for inflation, I blow a little hot and cold on thequestion of whether the underlying inflation rate has changed. WhereI am at the moment is that if it has changed, it has changed only atad and maybe it is basically unchanged in core terms. But whateverconclusion you draw about what's happened to the core inflation ratein recent quarters, I think what you have to be impressed with,notwithstanding all this talk about credibility and all the rest ofit, is that the only way that the core inflation rate is going to comedown is if there's a lot more slack in the economy. With thestructure of the economy today, there just doesn't seem to be much tosuggest that that's going to change in a downward direction in anyappreciable way, given the kinds of resource utilization patterns wehave right now. But that, I think, is going to create an acutedilemma for this Committee very soon, and I'm thinking in terms ofthis budget package. I don't know whether they will get one or not.I suspect that there's probably a better chance of that today than atany time in the recent past. And then all of a sudden we will havewhat we have all said we needed--what we have all been pleading for,begging for, and cajoling for. And it seems to me that the policydilemma that the Committee is going to face in those circumstances isgoing to be rather awesome even if long-term interest rates come down-19-5/15/90by themselves, which I'm sure they will.

At the same time, I don'tbelieve we have a lot of maneuvering room because we are in aprecarious position. I believe on the one hand that we have the riskof higher inflation and on the other hand that we're very close to thepossibility of tipping over into recession. I think the risk, if wego into recession, is greater than the risk of more inflation becauseI suspect that the underlying structure of inflation is not as firm oras high as may have been indicated by some of the recent statistics.I think that the credit crunch is real, and I don't thinkit's necessarily confined to real estate. I'm convinced that it'sgoing to get worse and that it is not necessarily the result of theregulators; I think it's a general concern on the part of lendersabout lending, about capital ratios, as well as about tougherexamination standards. So, I just don't see that going away, with alldue respect for the regulators recently urging the lenders to lendmore money. I think the real estate market is under identifiedpressure and also some that hasn't shown up yet. Included in thelatter, I would say, is the RTC situation; if this accelerates, shortterm we're going to get an even further depression of real estatevalues. And I think there's some real buyer resistance out there withregard to the price structure, particularly with that RTC overhang. Idon't think that has adjusted itself. And I'm concerned that in arecession situation, the change in revenue flows would really tanksome of these [firms involved heavily in] junk [financing] situationsand that the ripple effect of that kind of a credit problem would bevery severe. On the whole, I think the downside risks are quitesevere, and I'm frustrated about inflation on the other side. Onbalance, I just don't think this is the time to make a change.-20-5/15/90\n",

No; the other anecdotal information surroundingthis particular firm is that in two lines they are already sold outthrough the end of year and most of these sales are export oriented.So the steel side, at least the stainless steel side, seems to bedoing quite well. They tend to argue that it's a proxy for theeconomy. We've tested it, as the Chairman has indicated, and it doesless well than the [leading indicators] over time. They did postprice increases a month ago of 4 to 7 percent, and they had no problemmaking that stick.In terms of the national outlook, I want to thank Mike againfor making, I think, a real attempt to show us what we need to do ifwe want to tackle the inflation issue. Most of the risks in theforecast, it seems to me, are weighted toward having a little moreinflation or perhaps having it stay the same. I understand that thereare always going to be risks of fragility in financial markets; we'vetalked about that now for six months. And there is always a potentialbudget deficit deal. But I think we have to gear our monetary policyto the objective that we can achieve. I agree with Dick Syron thatcredibility is important, and I'm not sure we're maintaining it. I'mnot unduly pessimistic about inflation, but we do have an objective ofbringing it down and not much seems to be happening. I might quibbleon the cost of bringing it down, though.\n",

      "MR. KELLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, when Mike finished hispresentation a little while ago he made the remark that there are alot of jokers still in the deck to be turned over. I certainly agreewith that. But when you're playing a hand of cards there are thosethings that you know and those things that remain to be seen. If welook at the things that we know, they don't look that bad. Obviously,as the cards turn over, things could change a lot. But we know,looking at interest rates, that we lowered the federal funds rate insome tightening done for us by the market. Along with that, theaggregates have now slowed down a lot. I don't want to prejudge orput words in Don's mouth--he hasn't made his presentation yet--but Isuspect he thinks they're likely to speed back up. But if they keepdoing what they're doing now, then we're going to have a pretty slowrate of growth in the aggregates in 1990. Looking at the grossnational product, the best guess is that its growth is now runningaround 2 percent and the two preceding quarters before that were 1.1percent and 2.1 percent. That's clearly slow; it could reaccelerate.There has been talk around this table that at a 2 percent growth ratewe could make slow progress, but nevertheless progress, on inflation.If you look at inflation as measured by the CPI, we had an appallingfirst quarter but the two quarters before that were both under 4percent; and I think the increase is probably slowing downsubstantially from that bad first quarter now.John talked about the credit crunch. I think everybody wouldagree that there's something going on out there and we don't know whateffect it's liable to have. Nevertheless, there is some constraintand it could be substantial. So, the things that we know, taken all-in-all, suggest that the state of the world is not terriblyunsatisfactory. I think our policy pretty much has done what wedesired it to do; it's too early to say that it has been ineffectivein making some progress on the core rate of inflation. Core inflationcould certainly change on the up side and, if it does, we undoubtedlywill have to react. But I think that's far from sure. As aconsequence, for now \"steady-as-you-go\" makes sense to me.\n",

      "MR. ANGELL. Yes, Mr. Chairman, we do have some good news outthere that I think we ought to talk about. We only did $50 million inforeign exchange intervention during the intermeeting period and I'mmost grateful for that. In fact, I'm so grateful that I didn't eventalk about the ESF after having an antagonizing document in front ofme. But there's more good news than that. I counted out about 15segments of industries in which expansion seems to be the order of theday. Quite often, I think we become somewhat impacted by those thatare having the pain; those industries having a slowdown are more vocalthan those in which things are looking up. I was used to that withfarmers always describing things as mediocre or middling during timeswhen we had boom conditions and most of the rest of time describingconditions as poor. In terms of the small business outlook, I thinkwe had a diffusion index this morning that demonstrated the same sortof thing: that is, if you have as many people saying the outlook ispositive as you have saying that it's negative, then it's really boomconditions. So, I think we have to steel ourselves to the fact thatthere is going to be some pain out there. And, of course, when thatpain involves people getting used to house prices not rising as in the-22-5/15/90past, and in some cases coming down, we're going to feel that and seethat. But that may be better news in regard to attitudes about moneythan we realize. When people see house prices going up 15 percent peryear, I'm not sure whether that in some ways undermines their sense ofvalue for money. And when all of a sudden the peak on selling theirhouse passed, a lot of people said: \"My goodness! Why didn't I sellit earlier?\" It's sort of an attitude of: I want money; I'd like tohave dollar balances.So, I think this kind of pain may be a precursor for somebetter inflation numbers. The fact of the matter is, however, thatthere are some troublesome things on the inflation front. Basically,commodity prices are still rather troublesome, as far as I can see. Idon't care what index you look at, unless you get into some veryspecialized ones, there does not seem to be the kind of improvementthat you'd expect to see. Look at corn prices, soybean prices. Wheatprices went up because there was an announcement of a large increase.But it really is a troublesome indication to see commodity prices moveup as much as they did and then not move back down. I would agreethat at a time when the pain seems to be pervasive in many households,and when M2 and M3 seem to be growing very, very slowly, thatinformation ought not be ignored. I'd like to close by suggesting,when we are talking about a soft landing, that in any way the landingoccurs it certainly has been soft but there is an element in which anairplane wing as it approaches the ground gets what we call \"groundeffect.\" Ground effect means that you have an opportunity to havemore lift than you otherwise would have because of the proximity ofthe ground. As we're approaching the 90th month of this expansion, wehaven't had any abrupt pullups that might result in stalled spinsbecause after a stalled spin the wind does not produce much groundeffect as the plane comes crashing in.\n",

      "MR. JOHNSON. Actually, I feel a little better today aboutthe inflationary risks than I did maybe a couple of weeks ago, withsome of these more recent data. But once again, you can't tell muchfrom one or two months of numbers. I still am generally concernedabout the outlook, but these recent numbers cloud it up a bit.Consumption has been fairly modest, but the first-quarter real GNPnumber looked stronger than I would have expected. We see investmentplans running at 7-1/2 percent, which is pretty strong; I don't knowif that will actually materialize, but the plans are running fairlystrong. My concern is that with inventories fairly low--and I realize-23-5/15/90that there are incentives to keep them that way--demand seems to besufficient both on the investment side and the consumption side thatthe economy is poised to pick up if demand pressures develop. And myconcern is that they might develop from external sources. I didn'thear too many people that concerned about export demand, but havingjust been overseas and having talked to people there I still have someconcern about that. I feel more comfortable that the Bundesbank isgoing to deal with the inflation risk in Germany. Still, we see ratescoming down in France and other European countries; and in fact, eventhough I think East Germany and other east European countries aregoing to be facing recessionary-type conditions, I think all theirconsumption is going to turn to the West. Even if it's lower than inthe past, they're going to be buying goods. The outlook for theSoviet Union is grim because I don't think they're going to be able tosell anything. They may be able to barter a few things and they willbe able to sell energy and some of their raw materials, but nobody isgoing to buy any consumer goods from the Soviet Union. All industrialcountries are strained in terms of their productive capacity. Japanis still growing strongly in spite of their financial shake-out. AndEurope continues to show signs of strength. So, I'm fairly optimisticabout our export prospects and the improvement in our externalposition. But I do worry about what kind of pressure that's going toput on the inflationary situation going forward. So, I do think thereare some risks. Some of the financial indicators suggest it. Eventhough long-term interest rates have come down more recently--almost ahalf percentage point from where they were--they are still up over theintermeeting period. And as Governor Angell pointed out, commodityprices have been under some upward pressure. They look a littlemilder now, depending on which index you look at, but still they areup. What worries me the most is that the trade-weighted dollar isturning down. Even though the dollar had shown strength against theyen, a lot of that has changed recently. As someone reported, thetrade-weighted dollar is down 14 percent from its peak last year. Ifthat kind of trend continues, we may be faced with some prettysignificant external strength, and I don't know how much room we havefor that. So, that's a worry.I'm not as concerned about the credit crunch issue; I haveheard a lot of anecdotes and I think it is a potential risk, but justlistening to what people have said around here it seems like some ofthat is [unintelligible]. The aggregates have turned weaker, but Iwould argue that that has to do with some portfolio shifts that haveoccurred with the change in interest rates more recently, and I thinkthat will subside and we will see a return to more significant growth.So, I think we have to be very watchful and cautious. I think therisks are on the inflation side, but given the more recent data Idon't know if it's worth pressing immediately.\n",

But, as I think the Bluebookalso noted, to the extent that this was seen as the Federal Reservegiving extra emphasis to its inflation objective over time, those bondyields would move lower in nominal terms. Now, it's also fair to saythat the real bond yield might be higher in that case because I thinkthere would be a higher path of expected future real short-term ratesthan perhaps is built in now.

Because the dollar was firm throughthat period, although a lot was going on in Germany and Japan at thesame time, I'd be hard pressed to argue that inflation expectationshad picked up to such an extent as to overwhelmingly explain theincrease in nominal rates.

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any other questions for Don? If not,why don't I get started on the round table? Reflecting what I'mhearing among the Committee, I think what we're observing is somethingthat I suspect has not been evident in recent decades. I never recalla set of economic forces precisely that goes with what is developinghere, and I've been trying to forecast the economy for well over 30years. On the expansion side, I think the evidence is very clearlymounting; we are past the maximum durable goods squeeze and I thinkwe're beginning to see some flattening of profit margins at thisparticular stage [after earlier declines]. As a consequence, capitalinvestment is clearly showing some quickening pattern, and I thinkthat shows up in the orders and the appropriations and in variousqualitative measures. On top of that is this extraordinary inventorysituation, which continues to squeeze down--the issue Dick Syronraised. Of course, what that implies is that if we ever get to thebottom when we're getting a squeeze and there is any evidence oftightening worldwide--so that there are shortages not only in theUnited States but elsewhere--then the lead times will begin to moveand we really will begin to get the type of classic acceleration thatwe've seen many times in the past. At this stage the evidence on theorders side is that they continue to improve gradually although theyare by no means accelerating; the orders levels are just creeping up.The backlogs in real terms probably are flat to down, but that is amajor improvement from a year or so ago when the economy wasdeteriorating in the total durables and manufacturing areas. If-26-5/15/90anything, I would say the evidence of all of this is [that economicgrowth is] probably mildly accelerating.The trouble, however, on the other side is that we havesomething more than a merely minor financial disturbance. I thinkthere may well be more to this credit crunch than we're looking at; orto put it more exactly, I don't think we're through it yet. Theconcurrent data that we pick up all over the place suggest that therehas been, as has been stated, a mild pulling back. But there is noevidence that it has stopped. For example, all of the evidence aboutforward commitments, specifically on real estate projects and loans,is that this phenomenon is nowhere near over on the real estate side.And we don't know at this stage to what extent it has spilled over inany other direction. I find the money supply data--specifically M3,as Jerry has pointed out--mildly disturbing because they say ineffect, even if you take out the thrift part of M3, that there reallyis something that is constraining financial capacity even though theunderlying orders patterns suggest that there's something of a[unintelligible] considerably more forward momentum here. The data wehave on the credit crunch are, except for anecdotal evidence, notforward-looking. They are all historical--all basically something inthe past. The trouble with the past is that as we continue to pick itup [in these data] it gets worse. And before we're out of this, thishas to stabilize and turn around--or at worst just stabilize, even ifit stabilizes at pretty low levels--because it has to be having afairly significant contractionary effect out in the distance throughthe late spring and into the summer on a lot of construction projects,which are a very substantial part of the goods markets.So, where this all leads me is to the same type of dilemmathat I found myself in at the last meeting, where clearly there aredangers on both sides. When we look ahead, the probability is thatour next move will be on the up side because I do think one has topresume that this credit crunch is limited. The trouble, however, isthat at this point it is still growing; and to move to tighten at thisstage while the evidence is that the credit crunch is still occurringI think would be a mistake. Also, despite the fact that I think weprobably will be required to move up before we move down, I wouldn'tbe inclined at this stage to be asymmetric on the up side. This mightseem an odd way to put it, but although the odds suggest that that'sthe direction we will be going in, I'm not sure that we shouldposition ourselves in that manner until the credit crunch matter hasstabilized. Nonetheless, I do think that the inflation problem isvery troublesome. And while I would feel comfortable with \"B\" eithersymmetric or asymmetric, I must say I would prefer symmetric and wouldhave the policy record relate the concerns that have been expressedaround this table on the issues of inflation and the instabilitiesthat they create. But, like the last time, I think it's a tough call;and I suspect it may be no less easy as we get further on into theyear. So, my bottom line at this moment is \"B\" symmetric, but withextensive language in the policy record on the issue of inflation.\n",

My preference would be alternative B,asymmetric, given that I believe we're going to have to have somegreater restraint in the period ahead if indeed we're going to makeany progress toward lower inflation rates. However, I don't seeanything on the horizon that would urge us to move in the intermeetingperiod--between now and early July, for example. I can't imagine thatthese numbers are going to reverse so quickly that they would triggera further increase in the intermeeting period. There are ways,however, to get the message to the market for the credibilityargument. One is, as you've suggested, that it be stressed in thepolicy record which is read by the market; on the other hand, we couldhave an asymmetric directive. Either would give the view that we'restill interested and concerned about our credibility and will moveagainst inflation. As I say, I would prefer \"B\" with an asymmetrictilt simply because of the communication. But I could, and would,accept your proposal that it be stressed in the policy record.\n",

For the time being, I favor acontinuation of that policy. That would be \"B\" symmetric, in myjudgment. I do think, though, that it's a matter of timing. I don'tpretend to have any special insight about this, but it does seem to methat at best we can argue that the core rate of inflation remainsstuck in the 4 to 5 percent neighborhood in which it has been for sometime. And at the same time, as I think Manley was describing, the-29-5/15/90world more generally has become a somewhat more inflationary place.Some of the European countries in particular have taken advantage ofwhat's going on in Germany to stimulate their economies and so forth.And I think that does raise the odds, as you expressed, that we aregoing to have to tighten at some point in the future if we're going tounstick inflation.\n",

But there are many, many financial institutions out there--S&Lsand banks alike--that are pretty shaky, and there are more on the listof those that will be getting shaky.

I understand what people are saying about perceptionsbeing important at this time; the budget issue is one that I think isvery important. But that can almost play both ways. I would favoralternative B. When we come to the matter of symmetry or asymmetry, Ithink the credibility issue is very important. For that reason Iwould tend to favor asymmetric language--though that's almostsplitting hairs, depending upon what the policy record says. If thepolicy record is strongly worded enough and if it indicates the samething--essentially that if economic data start to come in and leanmore strongly than this most recent information and we don't see anyimprovement on the inflation front and the credit crunch reallydoesn't develop into something that's equivalent to the markettightening for us, then we understand that we are going to have totighten in the future.

      "MR. HOSKINS. Our goal is to achieve long-run pricestability. We have to make those decisions in the context of short-term policymaking and there is always lots of noise in the data whenwe do that. M2 is slowing; the yield curve may be flatter than itwas; maybe commodity prices always give us conflicting signals in theshort run because of the noise there. I asked Don Kohn questionsabout where M2 was likely to be at year-end if we do nothing; hisanswer was 6 percent or higher. We have done a good job. I'm notpessimistic about the long-term inflation outlook in the sense of itrising. We have had three years of 4-1/2 percent or so growth in M2.To give that away by producing a 6 percent growth in M2 this year isnot an acceptable policy to me if our goal is long-run pricestability. In terms of where I'd like to come out at year-end--and-30-5/15/90that will condition the way I would vote today--I would like to see M2come in at 4-1/2 percent or below, fourth quarter over fourth quarter.It seems to me that then we would be making progress toward pricestability. In terms of what M2 means right now, it's positive from mypoint of view in that it's slowing. But I'm not sure that it's goingto stay there. Somebody already has used the expression thatinsurance may be appropriate at this point in time. It's a lot easierto lower rates if we make a mistake in this environment than it isgoing to be to raise them down the road. In terms of the short-termoutlook, one can just simply look at the Greenbook, which alsosupports the notion that if we do nothing at best we'll stabilize theinflation rate and at worst we will have a rising inflation rate.

It'ssplitting hairs to make that point. However, like Dick Syron, I'm alittle worried that if over the intermeeting period we get a fewstronger numbers, our credibility could slip rapidly. I was veryconcerned for a few weeks before this meeting that we were right onthe edge of totally losing our credibility when we got the CPI andpurchasing managers' survey results; all the data were coming instrong. Of course, the more recent numbers have to some extent bailedus out. Maybe that's an indication that there was an illusion in thedata. Still, even if we go for symmetric with a slightly strongerrecord of our concerns, we should be prepared--if these numbers slipin the intermeeting period--to be able to swing all the way to anintermeeting move. I think we're in a situation where if, say, thecredit crunch concerns start to dissipate and all of a sudden we getone or two strong numbers, we may not make it to the next meeting withour credibility intact.

And thatuncertainty is such that, even though I'm in the mood to tighten and Iwas hoping we would be tightening, I do believe that it would be muchbetter for us to wait a couple of weeks and see what happens in thattime. We could act at that point in time rather than run the risk oftightening and then have conditions go in such a direction that ourcredibility is lost on the other side and that we would not be able todo what we need to do when we have to do it. So, in that sense, I'mvery sympathetic with your position, Mr. Chairman. I certainlyunderstand why prudence is in that direction. I would prefer that thedirective would read tighten now, but I can vote in the affirmativewith the understanding that we're very close together with someconsensus here which says: that we deem this attack against inflationto be a very high priority; that we think following that prioritygives the economic expansion more of an opportunity to develop and tostrengthen and to lengthen than not to do it; that we are steeled tobe ready to do what has to be done some time in the future; and thatthat is not to be deterred because there's a little bit of pain[involved]. I had been hoping we could get there in a painless waybut, frankly, what I have learned in 4-1/4 years tells me it's tougherthan I thought. I know from the experience in 1986 that once we'veeased it sometimes takes a lot longer for us to change direction totighten than it does to stop tightening and ease, because everybodylikes to ease. I just have a very strong compulsion at this point to-32-5/15/90be looking for an opportunity to get the fed funds rate up to where Ithink it ought to be. I'd be much more satisfied with an 8-3/4percent fed funds rate than with an 8-1/4 percent rate. I just don'tthink today is the time to do it.

I don't know what wewill eventually decide tomorrow, but it's clear that we may decide totake some action with respect to rates. Should that be the case, weare caught in a position where under our normal procedures we would begoing into the weekend with a very important decision having been madeand without public disclosure thereof. So, what I would intend to doat the end of our session today is to discuss contingency plans in theevent that we decide tomorrow actually to move toward tightening. Ifthat policy issue has to be resolved, we clearly have to do it in themorning, which means we would have to reverse our agenda and firstdiscuss the regular short-term policy issues that we usually discussand leave the long-term target issues as the second policy item on theagenda. In the event that we choose to do nothing, all we'll do iscreate a minor difference in the order we usually handle things. ButI think it's probably a worthwhile precaution in the event that wewe won't know for sure, but I think the point at issue here is that wenot be in a position where we are restricted in taking action becauseof concerns about security. So, later this afternoon I would like todiscuss a hypothetical case of what we might do even though it mighttake a few minutes to do so and it may not prove to be necessary. Butit's probably a worthwhile precaution.Let's move on now to item 2, which is the selection of aFederal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Opento make such a motion.\n",

Central banks around theworld are moving toward more arms length dealings with Ministries ofFinance. Certainly, the \"accord\" between the Federal Reserve and theU.S. Treasury over 40 years ago had that in mind. As I understand it,warehousing was proposed by Secretary Bill Simon in a letter toChairman Burns about a week or so before the Ford Administration leftoffice, and I can't for the life of me imagine why he did that. Ihaven't asked him yet, but I am going to ask him what was he thinkingwhen he did that. Subsequently, in 1979, there was legislationproviding for temporary lending in effect by the Reserve Banks to theTreasury because of so-called liquidity problems having to do withdebt ceiling limitations and all of that. That authority wascontroversial at the time; it lasted for only two years. It waswarehousing continues as a practice, or at least the authority isstill on the books for us to make a loan to the Treasury Departmentwhen it was generally agreed going back 80 years that that shouldhappen only under very, very exceptional circumstances. I would takethe latter to involve conditions warranting a full discussion by thisCommittee. So I think it's not appropriate for us to have a standingauthority for a line of credit for the Treasury to get us to lend tothem up to $5 billion. And I think we should not authorize this.\n",

      "MR. TRUMAN. Well, let me deal with the historical issuefirst. The reason why Secretary Simon proposed this arrangement in1977 was to establish a mechanism that would allow the United Statesto participate in the arrangementAs I remember, the arrangement was in effect for a periodof a year or two. It was a joint operation that had been negotiatedby the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The System was very muchinvolved, but the Treasury was also very much involved and thearrangement was linked toThe warehousing agreement was very much in that context.It was very well thought out; it wasn't a casual action. Thewarehousing facility had existed before that time, but it had beenmore ad hoc. It had existed in similar circumstances in the late1960s when there also was a special arrangementThe issue of whether warehousing is a loan is obviously aquestion primarily for the lawyers. This Committee faced that issuein 1990. There was one group who felt that it was a loan and shouldbe regarded as a loan. The lawyers have informed me that it shouldnot be considered a loan. It is a market transaction that's carriedoff at market rates. Although people can disagree with thatinterpretation, that has been the interpretation of this Committee todate. That is a matter of public record. That's the majorityinterpretation of the Committee, and it hasn't been challenged by themajority of Congress or even a substantial minority of Congress.\n",

Wage and salary disbursements aremuddled by all that income shifted into 1992 out of the first quarterof 1993. I would caution everyone that our expectation is that onceagain sometime during this year there will be a revision of thefourth-quarter income figures that will show at least some shiftingfrom the first quarter. Otherwise, we have a significant pickup individend income. We've already seen some upward movement in thatcategory in recent quarters; in fact, quite rapid in recent quarters.2/3-4/94Also, we have an acceleration in personal interest income.

Well, our expectation is that as the financinggap of the nonfinancial corporate sector widens, as I indicated, therewill be an increased need for credit by business firms and aconsiderable segment of that will be satisfied in the shorter-termincrease in bank credit. You have a flow of funds forecast thatportrays these flows. In the household sector we're anticipating, asI said, that the growth in borrowing will exceed the growth in income.We are anticipating that consumer credit will continue to grow fairlyrapidly in the near term, but that it will trail off a bit as theintensity of demand for durables wanes. Mortgage credit will continueto grow apace, in line with our forecast of residential constructionactivity. Otherwise, we have the Federal government's borrowingrequirements tailing off with the deficit, and State and localgovernments continue to borrow significant amounts of funds to supportthe investment that I referred to. So, overall, we have debt growthrunning pretty much in line with nominal income.We don't see great strains developing over the next two yearsin this scenario. We do see real interest rates increasing slightly,but at the long end we have nominal rates coming down a little in thenear term and then backing up slightly and in general remaining closeto their recent levels. This is a rather mild experience compared toprior cycles. Maybe that calls into question whether we've got thisright, but we do see fiscal policy in an unusual contractionary mode.That's one factor here, and it will be a while before the externalsector is exerting a lot of positive force on the economy. And withthe pent-up demands probably relatively limited coming out of a mildrecession, we think we'll work our way through those pretty rapidly;we've already gotten to a period of high-level housing activity. We-13-2/3-4/94don't think we're going to have to see sizable increases in interestrates in order to keep the economy on a growth path that is consistentwith some slight downward pressure on inflation.\n",

      "MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, with regard to the nationaleconomy, in terms of growth at least for this year our forecast isreally very close to the staff forecast, especially for the mainsectors involved, and any difference is really not worth talkingabout. Our overall CPI forecast is a little lower than the Boardstaff's; part of that I think is due to seasonal adjustment factors.Offsetting this, our core rate of inflation is just a little higherthan the staff forecast, so there is a little difference in ourexpectations with regard to energy prices.With regard to the District, the level of activity and Ithink the general tone of things and the underlying strengths arebetter now than they were at the time of the last meeting. Anddespite the really miserable weather that we've been having in theMidwest, so far I don't sense any dropoff in the level of underlyingactivity this year of the magnitude that we had last year.Admittedly, it's early to be coming to this conclusion, but certainlyin the Midwest we've not had the same kind of dropoff.The auto business, of course, continues to lead the way.Production schedules for the first quarter--it's hard to believe thesenumbers--have been set some 15 percent higher than the levels of lastyear or little more than that, and of course last year was a strongcomparative period. So the first-quarter production is going to bevery, very heavy. And in fact for some models, manufacturers are nowexperiencing some capacity constraints.The outlook for the heavy truck business has been improving.Producers are raising their forecasts some 5 to 10 percent above lastyear's sales and production levels, and again last year was a prettygood year. And related to this, the truck-trailer business isreported by one company to be absolutely on fire. The shortage oftruck shipping capacity is now a decided problem. Shippers havebecome concerned and are pushing the large companies to add to theirequipment and also to hire more drivers.Despite the adverse growing conditions last year in the agsector, farm incomes were good. Certainly farm attitudes coming intothe new year are positive, and this is reflected in continued strengthin the production and sales of ag equipment. The production schedulesfor one large manufacturer have been raised some 16 percent abovetheir earlier expectations for this year.Retail sales are surprisingly strong. Christmas, of course,was just terrific. Sales limitations, at least for some stores,resulted from the inability of suppliers to deliver and not fromresistance from customers. Again, despite the miserable weather, wereally have not seen as adverse an effect on retail sales as we mighthave expected. And to state the obvious, sales of snow shovels andbatteries have been phenomenal!-15-2/3-4/94In talks with representatives of various companies, I thoughtI'd mention three differences from what I noted the last time. First,despite higher sales levels--and I think Mike Prell had a chart thatdemonstrates this--inventories remain under very, very tight control.One large manufacturer reported that this is the first time in thehistory of their company that they've had a significant increase inproduction and sales and yet have not had an increase in inventories.They are obviously managing their inventories very carefully. Butthey are managing them on an absolute basis and not on a relativebasis. Second, while the now almost macho \"I'm not hiring any moreemployees\" statements continue to prevail, this time there were twoheavy manufacturers who said they are adding employees and this is asharp shift from their earlier \"not ever\" statements. Third, I'msensing some price pressures out there, and I think it's more now thanjust steel. Several contacts reported that the prices for theirpurchased products are edging up just a little. Also, in terms oftheir prices, though marketplace pressures remain competitive, theysaid they have been able to raise some prices and those increases aresticking. That is by no means prevalent nor are the increases large,but at the margin a subtle change seems to be occurring. So, I thinkthe outlook here is a little different than it has been.\n",

Mr. Chairman, while economic activity is healthyin most of the Twelfth District, weakness in California persists.Payroll employment, usually what we consider to be the most reliableshort-term indicator of economic activity for a state, continues tothe California economy is finally bottoming out. Following earlierlosses, real retail sales have stabilized during the past year or soand construction employment seems to have bottomed out as well. We'realso starting to see some encouraging signs in the housing sector,although it's still too early in our view to tell whether this is thebeginning of a true housing recovery. For example, the number of homesales has been rising for the past several months and there was asurge in sales in the month of December. The number of home permitsalso has risen in the last two months, although it is still very lowby historical standards. However, when we looked at what otherforecasters are saying about the California economy, no one expectsany significant improvement during the near term. Most forecastersexpect the California economy to be flat during the first half of thisyear with only very minimal growth during the second half of the year.Preliminary damage estimates from the earthquake put theproperty losses at $15 to $30 billion, depending on who is making theestimates. This makes it one of the worst U.S. natural disasters onrecord. Still, the quake probably will not change significantly theoverall pace of economic activity in the Los Angeles area. In the SanFrancisco area after the Loma Prieta Earthquake, earthquake-relatedreductions in business activity were largely offset by demolition,construction, and engineering activity associated with rebuilding.President Clinton has asked Congress to authorize $9.5 billion forearthquake relief and the California government ultimately willcontribute to the rebuilding efforts as well. It's a little difficultto estimate how much money will be coming from the state, but theexperience we had with the 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 suggeststhat it will cost the state between $1 and $2 billion.-16-2/3-4/94If I can now turn to the national economy, the strong growthin the second half of last year certainly, as we all know, hasnarrowed the gap between actual and potential GDP and has broughtunemployment down close to most estimates of the natural rate. We'rebasically in agreement with the Greenbook forecast for real GDP growthin the neighborhood of 3 percent for 1994 which, of course, wouldnarrow the gap further. I was struck when Mike Prell referred to thestubbornness of wage inflation in Chart 8. Growth in the employmentcost index as was indicated by that chart has been stuck at 3-1/2percent for quite a while. At current interest rates, it seems asthough we would not be able to expect any further progress in bringinginflation down in 1994 and clearly not in 1995.\n",

The only state that'san exception to that is Connecticut. Manufacturing--particularly indurables, products that are tied to autos and capital goods--lookspretty strong. Exports are still soft, however, and medical equipmentis one area where you might expect this. Producers of medicalequipment indicate that low ticket items are still doing all right,but that MRI machine orders, for example, are off about a third, whichagain it follows the national pattern with autos and high-tech goodsbeing better and some retailers in soft goods feeling that things arerelatively weak.

For New England, given the time of year, there's a lot ofconstruction activity going on that hasn't been reflected in pricesvery much yet. But we will have tight labor conditions in thebuilding trades this spring, particularly since there are so manyroofs to be replaced, ceilings to be put back in, and other repairsmade necessary as a result of the cold weather.

One of the indicators I use is how vociferously businesspeople complain. I was visiting with a group of 20 or 25 businesspeople in central Pennsylvania a couple of weeks ago and didn't hearany complaints. It was hard to keep them focused on talking about theeconomy. There is a sense that an increase in interest rates isalmost a foregone conclusion, all of which I interpret to mean thatthings are going well and they just don't want to talk about it verymuch. It's that Pennsylvania Dutch reticence, I think, on their part.There still is a reluctance to hire, but hiring is going onnonetheless in many parts of the District. I, too, have picked up ahint of perhaps a little more in the way of price increases--particularly in prices paid by business firms. It's not a lot, butthere wasn't much of a hint a few months ago.As for the nation as a whole, I think the momentum of lastyear has spilled over. I don't think the type of slowdown we saw ayear ago is very likely. The 3 percent growth rate or thereaboutsseems about right.

Retailers aregenerally keeping their inventories quite lean; they are waiting forindications of continued consumer interest before they build up theirspring inventory lines. If sales don't taper off, many of them aregoing to find themselves with stocks that are actually too low.Tourism is fairly healthy around the District with theexception of Miami, which is still suffering from bad publicity. Inproduction, our latest survey would indicate that compared to lastmonth things are looking quite good currently as are expectations forsix months from now; that's with respect to production, volume ofshipments, volume of orders, and the backlog of orders.

I might mention portactivity; it's apparent at least in New Orleans and perhaps in some ofthe other ports around the District that NAFTA is beginning to have apositive effect already.On the price side, for the first time in a long time ourdirectors have talked a little about seeing some price increases.This was basically in concrete and lumber, so it's evident at thispoint only in housing and construction more generally. Where there isimport competition, prices seem to be feeling no pressure. But Ithought it was interesting that we got those reports for the firsttime in many, many months. I would say that the sentiment in theDistrict is really quite good and what's interesting to me is thatthere no longer is this expectation that growth will be very robust.There is now a recognition that growth is going to be more moderateand perhaps more stable over the period.With respect to the national economy, we don't really haveany differences with the Greenbook forecast.\n",

      "MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, our District continues to grow ata very steady pace on the whole. Within the District, though--as Imentioned I think in November and I'll say it again today--there is alittle more of a boom-like atmosphere in the western and the northernportions. There is very strong housing and a shortage of labor inthat industry. Manufacturing is doing better, especially in thenondurable goods area. The slow areas are energy, except for naturalgas, which of course is a little more on a roll right now. Also, wethink we will have modest activity in the agricultural sector becauseof the floods and the effects from that.At the national level, our view is that inflation may run alittle higher than in the Greenbook forecast for a couple of reasons.Our GDP projection is a little stronger than the Greenbook's,especially in the second half of the year. But also we have estimateda little lower unemployment rate and we have a little higher, I guess,natural rate of unemployment in our thinking than the Greenbook andthat is generating added price pressures as we see it in ourprojections. I would add to that on the other side a point that maybe of interest in terms of the amount of liquidity that is in thesystem. In talking with some fund managers, it seems to us that an-19-2/3-4/94attitude is developing--almost a bandwagon effect--in terms of theflows of some of these funds into investment opportunities they areseeing. We are hearing a lot of this going on--emerging markets andthose sorts of things--from these fund managers, and we take note ofthat. I think it is having some impact on attitudes in the economy.That, Mr. Chairman, is how it looks.\n",

Mr. Chairman, at the last meeting I talked alittle about the differences between the rich and the poor, and Ifocused primarily on how taxes would affect the rich and how thatmight affect our forecast. I got some compliments, so at the risk ofdiscouraging all praise, I thought I'd try it again and this timefocus on the other end of the spectrum--the bottom 99 percent of whichI am clearly a part. The thesis here is that demographicallydifferent people have different tolerances for borrowing. The twogroups that I have separated out were individuals over 65, who areunlikely to incur additional debt for life-cycle reasons, and those inthe top 1 percent in terms of income, which is roughly people makingover about $225,000. I would imagine that debt may be a conveniencefor them but it is not subject to their economics. The data that Ihave come from a number of sources. Generally, they are from the P60series the Labor Department puts out and also some tax data.The first chart in my handout, which I think was distributed,shows that we have a trend that has developed over time where theshare of income going to the old has risen since the end of World WarII; it has more than doubled. And the share of income going to thesetwo groups, the old and the rich, has just about doubled.\n",

      "MR. LINDSEY. That's right. Well, we struggled with thatlabeling. I started with the \"middle-aged middle class\" and thatdidn't sound too good. So, we ended up calling it those likely toborrow of the non-rich, non-old.The next chart shows the debt service adjusted for Chart 1which is the rise in the income share of the old and the rich. Thebottom line with the triangles on it shows the regular series that ispresented by the staff and the top line shows the adjusted series.The adjustment seems to make some difference, particularly in recent-20-2/3-4/94trends. If you apply debt service to those of us who actually have toborrow, it's quite high. The same is true on the debt outstandingshare, on the next chart, which again assumes that debt is being borneby those who have to borrow. It's now up to 110 percent of disposableincome, whereas the more standard measure puts it around 75 percent.So, I would say that those who actually have to borrow to expand theirspending are probably more constrained than the data that we've lookedat indicate. I might say that these are not publication-qualityanalyses, but what I did to see if my thesis worked was to tryapproaching it from an entirely different angle. So, rather than useP60 data, my next approach was to go to the NIPA data and see if thatshowed the same effects based on a functional distribution of income.The first thing that's important to realize is that the NIPAdata do not mean income earners actually get the money. I convincemyself of that every year when I do my taxes, when I also compile formy wife a breakdown of our income and where it was spent. I find thatuseful because I always tell her we never have any money but we end upmanaging to spend lots of it and she never believes me. So I presentthe actual breakdown and she is forced to concede the facts. Theinteresting point that I want to make here is that not all NIPA incomeis actually spendable by households, and that's particularly true withregard to interest and dividends. For example, the income thataccrued on your 401K plan is counted as interest and dividend incometo you, but you really can't get at it. And that actually is a veryimportant phenomenon in the economy. So, I broke down the NIPA incomeinto a number of areas. Cash income--excuse me the chart says \"cash\"but it should say wages--wages are basically all paid in cash. Onlyabout 8 percent is received by the rich and 3 percent by the non-richelderly. So, 89 percent is received by those of us who are likely toborrow. Of interest income, only about 45 percent actually finds itsway to the households where it can be spent. And the way I got thisnumber was to look at the ratio of what is reported on tax returns towhat is reported in NIPA. The tax return data probably are fairlyreliable at the moment, since paying institutions are now required toput out a statement for everything over $10. So, only about 45percent of interest in the economy actually is received by households.\n",

      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. LINDSEY. They are using the same data, yes. I had toget the income for the elderly too, so I had to go back and look attax return data where people used an exemption for those over 65; thatflagged the returns to be used in the tabulation. It turns out thatonly about 14 percent of total NIPA interest is actually received bypeople likely to borrow. The same is essentially true of dividends--16 percent--and of small business income at 27 percent. The incomeretained by small businesses includes such things as inventoryappreciation, capital consumption allowances, what have you, whichwhile income really can't be eaten or used to pay a credit card bill.That's why the distinction is here. The reason I think that'simportant is that what we're seeing is a big change in the functionaldistribution of income away from wages, particularly in the last twoyears. For a comparison period, I took the change in personal incomefrom 1983 to 1988 which was of course the heyday of Reaganomics whenwe all know workers were being stomped on by the capitalists who were-21-2/3-4/94in power! Still, in spite of that, 56 percent of all the increase inpersonal income was paid in the form of wages. If you turn to thelast chart, of the increase in personal income in 1992 and 1993 only47 percent was paid in wages. During 1993 that fell to 38 percent.And even during the fourth quarter of 1993, when everyone was sayinghow good the economy was and optimism was rising, only 38.4 percent ofthe increase in personal income actually was in the form of wages.So, the way I would talk about the last three charts is that the non-rich, non-old live paycheck to paycheck, quite literally. That'swhere all their income comes from. Remember, virtually none of thecapital income or business income goes to them. They have to live ontheir wages and that wage share is also declining. So, whether youlook at the aggregate numbers from NIPA or at the aggregate numbersfrom the P60 series, the middle-class, middle-aged people who areborrowing are really getting their income squeezed. What that wouldsuggest to me is that unless the trends change and employment picksup, the capacity of households to take on ever more debt is going tohave to stop at some point, and perhaps sooner than we think.\n",

      "MR. BROADDUS. My report is going to be pretty bland afterthat, but developments since the December meeting have simplyreinforced my view that the economy is moving ahead nationally at agood clip. Also, the recent national data show that the economyfinished 1993 on a high note, and it seems clearly to have entered thecurrent year with a lot of momentum.In our District our directors and other business contactsreport that economic activity is continuing to strengthen and improvepretty much across the board. There may be a little more strength inthe southern part of the District--in the Carolinas--wheremanufacturing is dominant and a little less in the northern part ofour region where defense and other government activity is moredominant. But, clearly, the District is in good shape overall. Intheir comments at all three of our board meetings in January severalof our directors described conditions in their respective local areasas booming. Even the Charleston, South Carolina area, for example,which has been hard hit by naval cutbacks is described as doingreasonably well under the circumstances. This is not to say thateverybody in our District is happy about the present and optimisticabout the future, but I think it's fairly accurate to say that theoverall tone of the information we're getting is about as good as itever gets on average in this business. The outlook and attitudestoward at least the near-term future among most of our business peopleare pretty optimistic. I don't think they are expecting anysignificant slowing in activity. The severe winter weather in recentweeks has been disruptive, to put it gently, and it may havesuppressed activity a little. But I think much of that loss isexpected to be temporary and made up in the months ahead. Also, mostpeople around here don't deal with the sub-zero temperatures verywell, so plumbers and body shops have been doing quite well latelyalong with cab drivers and electric utilities and franchises thatdeliver pizza!As far as the national situation is concerned, the Greenbookprojections for 1994 certainly seem reasonable to us, not that theyneed our blessing, but they impress us as fully defensible. We are a-22-2/3-4/94little stronger on real GDP growth and a little lower on inflation.Our projections have GDP growth at 3.2 percent and a CPI of 2.9percent. I would say that the risk of error on those numbers--I'm notsure my staff would agree with me on this--is probably tilted to theup side.I don't want to jump the gun on the policy discussion again,but I do need to say just by way of explaining--\n",

I'm certainly hearingfewer comments of concern about the future or about the fragility ofthe current expansion; that has diminished. One aspect of the economythat I have commented on before and I'll just reiterate briefly isthat we have had steady employment growth and we have low unemploymentrates in most of the District states now. That tends not to beremarkable in heavily agricultural states, but we have lowunemployment rates in most of the major metropolitan areas as well,which I think is a more significant way of looking at it. And we arehearing a variety of reports of labor shortages now--not at theunskilled end of the labor market, but at levels above that clearlythere are growing reports of labor shortages. That does not seem tohave translated into discernible wage pressures yet. But that seemsto me almost inevitable. At some point along the line here one of thereactions is going to have to be some wage pressures both to attract,but maybe more importantly to retain, some of the workers who are inshort supply.With regard to the national economy, in looking at theGreenbook and listening to Mike Prell's comments, I took the staffforecast to be a sort of \"more of the same only less so\" forecast.What I mean by that is that the economy grew over the second half ofthe year somewhere between 4 and 4-1/2 percent in real terms. If we-23-2/3-4/94get away from disturbances because of the weather and auto schedulesand so on, I conclude that we're going into 1994 with a good deal ofmomentum, more momentum probably than the Greenbook forecast seems toincorporate. So I feel pretty good about the state of the economy,but that also implies that at least under current circumstances we'renot going to bend inflation down further from here.\n",

      "MR. JORDAN. In spite of my own doubts about the matter, Iconsistently run into the expectation throughout our District thateventually it will thaw out! It's an the area of the country wheresevere winter weather seems to have absolutely no negative effect onpeople's mood and outlook.We also hear the stories of shortages of certain classes oflabor and the difficulty of hiring. Some of our major manufacturingareas are reporting under 4 percent unemployment. I hear the sameexpressions of reluctance to hire that others apparently still arehearing although Ohio, for instance--whatever the credibility of thedata--showed a 3-1/2 percent increase in employment last year. So,they \"reluctantly\" hired a lot of people. The last time I saw boththese kinds of numbers and this rather pervasive mood of \"everything'sokay and getting better\" was when I lived in southern Californiaduring the roaring boom in the latter 1980s before the bust. Si hasalready mentioned a lot of the region-specific and the sector-specificdevelopments that also relate to our area. I'm not going to gothrough those in detail. One thing that I could add on the motorvehicles side, after calling around to various plants in the District,is that they are estimating that the weather reduced production bysome 60,000 to 70,000 vehicles in the quarter and not all of that willbe made up. Industry contacts tell us that some of the plants, byrunning overtime, can make up lost output by the end of March; othersare telling us that their production schedule for the quarter wasalready such that they are not going to be able to make it up; theyview these as permanent losses in production. Some of the plants wereshut down totally for as much as four days. All of the lenders in theDistrict are talking about very strong credit demands--commercial,consumer, and residential. I haven't heard any reference to thenotion of a credit crunch in some time now.On the national side, my forecast is that the numbers for thelast two years will be revised substantially and that once we get thatrevision three or four years from now and look back on the period, alot of these intra-year patterns will go away. A smoothing processwill indicate that we didn't have a weak first half last year and aboom in the second half, but more or less that the economy in the lastcouple of years has grown somewhere in the 3 to 4 percent range, andthat won't look quite so odd. When I look at year-ago expectationsabout 1993 and then look at the numbers that we had on balance,abstracting from the intra-year pattern, real output growth was aboutwhat was expected a year ago and the CPI came in about as wasexpected. Yet during the course of the year, the numbers for 1994generally continued to show an upward revision for inflation. And nowthe numbers for 1995--we've only had a couple of forecasts that go outto 1995--are already showing higher numbers. In fact, the numbers wenow have for 1995 are higher than the numbers we had for 1994 a yearago; 1993 similarly was progressively moved up. So, it's a pattern-24-2/3-4/94that implies becoming accustomed to accepting no further progress oninflation, and I find that very disturbing. If those numbers areaccurately based on current policy or the assumption about what policywill be, then I think the conclusion would have to be one of twothings: Either we have changed our objectives with regard toinflation or we have to change our policies. Otherwise we're going tosend the wrong message to people who look at these numbers to gaugethe Committee's real intent.\n",

      "MR. MELZER. Our outlook for real growth next year issomewhat more optimistic than that of the Greenbook, but in the caseof inflation our outlook is considerably more pessimistic. Nearly allof the macroeconomic indicators have become increasingly favorable andpoint to a strong and sustainable expansion. But the down side ofthis, of course, is that both capacity utilization and unemploymentare approaching levels that raise concerns about how long the economywill stay in the disinflationary mode. In addition, recoveries in theeconomies of U.S. trading partners as indicated in the Chart Show'salternative scenario might also generate demand pressures that wouldlead to price increases.Like the national economy, our District economy continues toimprove and in some sense has been outperforming the national economy,at least in terms of employment growth. Many firms have reportedincreases in sales and employment. In fact, in at least two parts ofthe District that I've heard about recently, northwest Arkansas andnortheast Mississippi, labor shortages have curtailed industrialexpansion. District retailers report good-to-strong sales of mosttypes of merchandise during the holiday and post-holiday periods.Single-family home building is unseasonably strong in many parts ofthe District, largely because builders are scrambling to start andfinish projects that were delayed in the latter half of 1993 becauseof wet weather. After several years of stagnation, multifamilyhousing construction appears to be on the upswing, as apartmentoccupancy rates and rental rates edge up. And as is the casenationally, sales of new and existing homes have been relativelystrong lately and average selling prices continue to rise. Inagriculture, soybean stocks nationally are down 49 percent from lastyear and corn stocks are down 62 percent. The stocks/use ratios forthese crops are only 7.6 percent and 10.4 percent respectively, whichare the lowest levels we've seen since the mid-1970s. So, clearly, inthose areas we are quite vulnerable to any kind of weather shocks.One final comment: Loan demand both nationally and at the Districtlevel seems to have increased. At a number of our large Districtbanks, we have reports of a significant increase in all majorcategories of loans during the last two months of the year relative tothe previous two months.Let me just end up with some comments about inflation. Weproject that the CPI will move up sharply in 1994 and will be evenhigher in 1995. Indeed, there may be some early warning signs thatthe economy's disinflationary course has already come to an end. Whenits volatile food and energy components are removed, the CPI rose at a3.4 percent rate during the last three months of 1993, upsignificantly from the 2.4 percent rate of increase during theprevious six months. The CRB futures price index is up by nearly 13-25-2/3-4/94percent from its level a year ago despite a very significant declinein energy prices. An even sharper increase is seen in the Board'sexperimental commodity price index when the food and crude oilcomponents are omitted.In addition, long-term interest rates have risen somewhatfrom their October 1993 lows. In our view, measured either by thegrowth rates of M1 and reserves or the ex post real federal fundsrate, the stance of monetary policy has been very expansionary forabout the last three years, and we weigh this sustained stance ofmonetary policy heavily in making our forecast of longer-run inflationtrends.\n",

      "MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, my sense of the course of eventsis in flux. As far as the strength of the economy goes, I had beenthinking up through the time of the last meeting that we were indeedgoing to have a strong fourth quarter but that we would be looking atsome substantial moderation after that. The fourth quarter now doesappear to have come in meaningfully stronger than I had thought andthat seems to be accompanied by considerably more momentum than I hadanticipated. The new data that we've been receiving recently lookquite strong to me. The purchasing managers' report across all of itscomponents looks strong--in new orders, the deliveries stretching out,and the prices paid. We also got very strong housing numbers and verystrong new orders data. In short, the new data suggest to me that theeconomy has more momentum than I would have thought; and in fact itstrikes me that it wouldn't take a whole lot for me to begin to usethe word that I've heard a couple of times in this go-around--anemerging \"boom.\"There are a couple of concerns that worry me. Number one isthat consumer debt seems to be accelerating, and this is at a timewhen the ratio of consumer debt to worth is still at an all-time high.It never came off; it just flattened out. The debt service rate camedown with lower interest rates but not the level of absolute debt.And if we get a surge from here, we are going to be setting all kindsof new records for the ratio of debt to income. That is of particularconcern as it would relate to the data that Larry Lindsey gave us awhile ago. That's pretty worrisome in my mind. Also, we seem to meto be experiencing a rather euphoric stock market; it's up 11 percentin the last four months and 6 percent since our last meeting, forgoodness sake! These kinds of developments give me concern that wecould possibly be heading for something that might look distressinglylike a bust somewhere down the road.On the inflation side, if we look at things with a fairlylong-term view, they still look pretty good. But like Tom Melzer--Ihad written down in my notes a couple of things he just mentioned--Ihave concerns. Number one is that fourth-quarter CPI of 3.4 percent,which looks a bit ominous. Also, in a world full of capacity, justabout all of the commodity price indexes that I've had access to, bothdomestic and international, seem to have a rather persistent upwarddrift. I certainly wouldn't try to say that an inflationary surge isupon us or is inevitable. But as John Wayne used to say in his Indianmovies, \"There's dust on the horizon!\" [Laughter]-26-2/3-4/94\n",

But the taxshock and the health care uncertainties are still unknown andunmeasured and are probably the governors which will keep the economicengine from running amuck. Perhaps even corporate re-engineering isnow ho-hum, at least for those not getting the heave-ho. [Laughter]Inflationary pressures may currently be masked and the resultingeuphoria in the financial markets probably has bloated stock and bondprices beyond rational values. That may be built more on profitexpectations than on actual profit performance. In short, I think weare now in a period where the expansionary forces in the economy seemto be emerging as the reasons for caution rather than thecontractionary forces that I had reasoned were fundamental before.Moderate growth seems to be the consensus forecast, but thepossibility of inflationary behavior triggered by inflationaryexpectations in terms of anticipatory price increases rather thandemand-driven price increases creates for me a mood for caution.\n",

Peopleare spending and they're dissaving to do so. Inventories are lean sothere probably will be no surprises on the supply side. Productivityimprovements can still provide opportunities for competitiveness andgrowth. I think most encouraging has been consumer and businessconfidence; even the earthquake and the cold didn't provide muchdisruption. So there is less chance that we're going to have anotherfading spell, and I don't think that this recovery now can beconsidered as fragile as it was a year ago. At the same time, strongfinancial markets are continuing to provide financing, and banks arebetter positioned to contribute. We are even making some progress onthe debt side. The risks and structural adjustments facing theeconomy are still there, but I think it's fair to say that no newinsurmountable ones are appearing. People may have gotten a bittired, as John LaWare mentioned, of talking about corporaterestructuring and defense restructuring, and the pace of balance sheetrestructuring appears to have slackened. On the international front,there's some glimmer that the economies of our major trading partnersare beginning to bottom out, so we may see some improvement there.The labor market is still showing some signs of stress due to thelayoffs and re-engineering, resulting in part-time and temporaryemployment and downward mobility. On the fiscal policy side, I thinkthe focus on the deficit may well contain many of the new initiatives;even the health care proposals now appear to be open to negotiations.So, I think there's a bit less to fear there, and there were no greatsurprises in the form of major new expensive initiatives in the Stateof the Union message.On the inflation front, the recent numbers certainly lookgood, particularly the PPI and the deflator, and I think the Committeeshould be very pleased with that. Progress on the underlying rate ofinflation, while it may still be feasible, certainly is going to be at-27-2/3-4/94a reduced pace at best. I'm a bit concerned, though, that we arelikely to hit a stone wall over the next few months with respect toinflation, given the problem with the seasonals, obviously, and short-term supply distortions. Many of those were mentioned around thetable with respect to labor shortages and supply shortages in areaswhere demand is particularly strong. We may well start to seecommodity price increases working their way into the PPI and CPI. Ithink that we're now seeing some major risks on the inflation front.Certainly, the Greenbook acknowledged the food price increases and therisks with respect to the upcoming harvest, which Tom Melzer mentionedin particular. On the energy front, it's hard for me to see that weshould be depending on a cartel to keep the CPI in check. And, ofcourse, precious metals' prices have been elevated. Certainly, themoney numbers are difficult to read but I agree with those around thetable today who mentioned that credit has picked up, so I think all ofthese things highlight the risk we now see on the inflation front.\n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Well, after some extended period ofa very flat regional economy, economic activity in the Second Districthas actually been improving at a moderate pace for about the lastthree or four months. The December establishment survey showed modestjob gains in New York State, New York City, and New Jersey. Over theknow are an advance indicator of personal income, were growing at amoderate to strong pace. The cold weather conditions seemed to havedelayed some output, but our sources feel that it is not any worsethan that. The inability of consumers to get to the sales takingplace in January slowed down some of the activity at the retail level,but again our sources feel that retailers can recoup that over thePresident's Day weekend, assuming the weather is decent then. I thinkwhat's particularly good about the District is that, despite the factthat we have the corporate giants like IBM, Citibank, and Kodakdownsizing, New York State gained 15,000 jobs from November togains in the area. New York City also had some growth in jobs as didour part, the northern part, of New Jersey.With regard to the national forecast, we are rather similarto the Greenbook with some exceptions. We have stronger real growthin the second half of 1994. Some of that comes, as does somewhatstronger growth in 1995, from our view that residential constructionwill be somewhat higher than the staff forecast has indicated. That'san area in which there are some capacity constraints, so it could bean additional cause of some inflationary pressures. In general, wethink the gap between actual and potential GDP is now quite small, andcertainly that which remains will be used up in the course of 1994with our forecast, the Greenbook's, or any of those we've heard aroundthe table. Consequently, with the unemployment rate coming down towhat we think is a reasonable estimate of the NAIRU--in the low 6percent area--we do have to be considerably concerned about inflation.And our inflation forecast is, in fact, somewhat higher than that ofthe Greenbook.\n",

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. We've completed the generaldiscussion that we usually have on the first day of Humphrey-Hawkinsmeetings. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to reverse the schedule-28-2/3-4/94tomorrow to deal with the short-term monetary policy questions firstand then go to the long-term ranges. The question I want to raisethis evening before we close is one that has been tugging at me forthe last number of weeks. This really gets to the issue that when wemove in this particular context, which of course will be the firsttime we have moved since September 1992, we are going to have to makeour action very visible. It's more the equivalent of a discount ratemove than the incremental federal funds rate changes that we have beenembarking on for quite a long period of time. I am particularlyconcerned that if we choose to move tomorrow, we make certain thatthere is no ambiguity about our move. My understanding of thetechnical conditions in the funds market is that it looks as thoughthe funds rate will probably be edging above 3 percent, and in thecircumstances a draining action will be unambiguous to theprofessionals. But I'm not sure that more widespread recognition willcome out very quickly; it will sort of dribble out. Under ordinarycircumstances, that is not only fine but desirable. One of the thingsthat we have argued, and I would continue to argue, is that there is adistinction between a discount rate and a federal funds rate action inthe sense that we don't want an announcement effect ordinarily on thefunds rate. It gives us a much more calibrated instrument. But afederal funds change in this particular instance is a discount ratechange, as far as the Federal Reserve System is concerned. I'm verystrongly inclined to make it clear that we are doing this but to finda way to do it that does not set a precedent.I understand that that is not at all easy to do, but if weare going to make changes as to how we structure our Minutes and ourannouncements and responses to various developments, we need a lot oftime in this Committee to discuss the pros and cons. There really arelots of pros and cons, of which I think we are all aware. But we aregoing to have to deal with this issue in conjunction with the questionof transcripts and tapes and all of the other disclosure issues. Oneof the reasons that I thought it was not desirable to discuss it atthis meeting is that there is clearly a time problem. There also willbe a lot of significant, useful evidence for us in our deliberationswhen we see how everyone responds to our releasing the last fourtranscripts of 1988 meetings when they are done. We'll get a muchbetter sense of the reactions. So, I'm caught in this particularsituation where I would feel very uncomfortable if when we make amove--whether it's tomorrow or next month--we do not make it veryclear that we are moving. The only issue on the table tonight is thatif we decide to move tomorrow--and that we will get to when we resumethe meeting at 9:00 tomorrow morning--I would very much like to havethe permission of the Committee to announce that we're doing it and tostate that the announcement is an extraordinary event. The majorreason would be that it's a Friday and we rarely meet on Fridays.This is a very unusual circumstance. So I'd like the permission ofthe Committee to try to formulate a couple of sentences which state(1) that we have moved, assuming we do that, and (2) that thisannouncement of the move is not precedential. We will try to find away to say what is special about this particular day and thisparticular event. So, I open it up for everyone's comments.\n",

While I myself, as you know, have beenstrongly opposed in the past--and I have testified against announcingwhen we are making a move since it does reduce our flexibility--thatissue is still on the table and it's a much broader issue. The issueof whether something is precedential or not is under our control. Wedon't have to announce our policy moves; there's nothing forcing us todo so, and I cannot believe that there will be legislation requiringthat. So, the issue is not whether if we do something, we will beforced to do it again. I think we can avoid that. We may decide forreasons other than basic policy to continue, but I see no reason forsuch an announcement to be a precedent nor do I see any likelihood oflegislation requiring that because the thrust of what's been happeningon the Hill doesn't strike me as leading in that direction.

All I was saying is this: Just as you thought,appropriately, that it's worth seeing when we put out the transcriptswhat the reaction is going to be, we'll also get information if wefollow this course from what the reaction is to it. There will beinformation in terms of market and Congressional reactions, and soforth. If essentially we tell the financial markets what our policyis at 11:23 of the morning after our meeting--if it is really the casethat by our market operations we generally do that--I have a lot ofsympathy for doing it more explicitly the evening before. My own viewis that by doing this once we will get some information on reactionsand we may find out what its weight is. My own forecast would be thatthis would pull the teeth in a longer-term sense, which we are notresolving now, on a lot of these issues about disclosure. I knowthese issues wouldn't all go away, but the essential information iswhat the final score of the game is. The rest of it is akin tofinding out what play Emmitt Smith was asked to run on third down. SoI think there is a lot to be gained from this without locking us intoa longer-term arrangement.\n",

One is with respect to the process and the other issubstance. It strikes me that this is a very major change in the waywe are operating and we haven't had very much time to reflect on this.As Bob Parry just indicated, I think it is essential that we do havethat discussion as soon as we can. My more serious concern is whetherwe can keep this non-precedential. I have a real concern that there'sa risk that we're going to be pushed by pressures--not necessarilylegislation but other pressures--to make this an ongoing operatingprocedure. If that's the case, I think we would lose someflexibility. The other thing that occurs to me is that if we areforced by this action to do it on a regular basis, the discount rateis going to lose its effectiveness and along with that theeffectiveness of our directors. So, those are concerns that I thinkwe need to reflect on, if indeed our announcement does for some reasonbecome a precedent. However, having said that, if we can draft astatement that clearly indicates this is not a precedent but a one-time event because of the peculiar circumstances, then I would supportyour recommendation.\n",

Basedon what you said there and the way that went, I would trust that youwouldn't be saying that \"the Committee tightened,\" using that kind ofjargon but rather that because of the nature of the change beingcontemplated--and it doesn't matter whether it's tomorrow or at theupward direction on interest rates. And it's not just that it wouldbe the first change since September 1992; it's the first change upwardin some five years. Without repeating all the discussion that we hadin December about the importance of a rate increase being clearly-31-2/3-4/94understood as being an action of the Committee, the rationale for itas a growth-sustaining move is extremely important. Only by puttingout a statement can we get that message out there, or at least make aneffort to say that this is not an anti-growth move but one that isdesigned to enhance the longevity of this expansion.\n",

I agree with you that itought to be your statement as the Chairman rather than an announcementof the Committee. I sympathize with your desire to make it short.However, I think it is good to get the right focus on this, and Iliked the way you ended your testimony on Monday about putting this inthe context of being pro sustainable growth rather than fostering thisnotion that we are against growth. I would urge you in the statementto hark back to your testimony on Monday; I have forgotten the precisewording in the last sentence or two in the last paragraph but Ithought that captured the essence of what we're doing very well. Atthe risk of this statement being a little longer than you may want,I'd just put in that last paragraph--or the last couple of sentences--from your testimony.\n",

      "MR. PRELL. Earlier this morning I had a brief discussionwith a senior official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thecivilian unemployment rate for January was reported at 6.7 percentunder the new survey. They have two econometric models that they areusing to try to give people some guidance about how the month-to-monthmovements in the unemployment rate might have looked if the new surveyhad been in place in December or if the old survey had remained ineffect in January. On the basis of their model of what the old surveywould have done, they estimate that the unemployment rate would havedropped 0.1 percent in January. Their model of what the new surveywould have done is that it would have dropped 0.3 percent. There is aconsiderable range; the household series is clearly subject to a lotof uncertainty. There was a huge increase, 1.3 million, in thehousehold employment total. As I indicated, there are both the changein the new monthly survey plus an adjustment for a Census updateinvolved here. A rough guess is that, if you took out those twospecial effects, the month-to-month change might have been in the areaof 150,000 or maybe a little higher, but that is a very crude guess atthis point. The labor force participation rate was 66.7; it had been66.3 in December. One might have expected an upward movement from thechange in the survey of 1/2 percent or more. And so on that basis itlooks as if the labor force participation rate might have dropped andcontributed to that decline in the unemployment rate, all other thingsequal. Again, this is very difficult to read. The nonfarm payrollincrease was 62,000--72,000 for private industry--well below marketexpectations and below what we had been expecting for the near term.Manufacturing was up 26,000 but construction was down 3,000 andprivate service-producing industries had an increase of 51,000. Therewere no large revisions to the prior couple of months.The Labor Department believes that weather had a seriouseffect on the payroll increases, particularly in construction. Theynoted that in parts of the country that we wouldn't expect to be muchaffected by weather at this time of the year, construction was up,whereas in parts of the north central and eastern regions, where theweather ordinarily is very cold, they found that construction wasdown. They also pointed to weakness in a number of other industrygroups that they think might have been affected by weather, such asrecreational amusement, and they mentioned that some collegesevidently had to cancel athletic events. In their minds all thesethings evidently contributed to the low increase in payrollemployment. Now, this may also have affected the mix of full-time andpart-time employment for the month. The average workweek is estimatedto have risen to 34.8 hours, a relatively very high workweek, from the34.5 hours figure in December; that was revised down from 34.6 hours.This does look fluky; we've seen ticks up to this level sometimesrevised away a bit and in other cases just reversed. So this rise mayprove ephemeral. The index for the overall increase in productionhours went from 125.2 to 126.3 reflecting that workweek increase.Actually, the way the arithmetic goes, they report the hours, thenderive the average workweek. But that's the better part of a-41-2/3-4/94percentage point. That's a much stronger start on the quarter than wehad anticipated.Overall, taking all of these things into account, my readingof this would be that there are signs that perhaps the outlook is abit stronger than we had anticipated in the Greenbook and wouldprobably imply our leaning more toward raising our first-quarter GDPforecast rather than lowering it. Given the very strong car salesthat were reported yesterday, that gives some greater credibility tothe production schedules for February and March. That output will beneeded to keep inventories from being utterly depleted even if salesdon't maintain their January pace. That, too, argues for some upsiderisk to the 4 percent GDP forecast we made.One final note on average hourly earnings: They were up .7in January. Again, this may have been affected seriously by the shiftin the industry mix and more importantly in all likelihood the shiftin terms of part-time/full-time employment and so on. So, I don'tthink one would want to read that number too closely either, but itcertainly does look as if it's on the firm side of our expectationsfor the start of the quarter.\n",

The reference week for the survey wasthe week before the California earthquake and the East coast snow andice storms; the extreme cold over much of the nation during thereference week held down employment. Indeed, the weakness in thepayroll survey was quite concentrated in weather-sensitive industriesin January, while other industries continued the pattern of moderategrowth that has prevailed for some time.\" And then she goes on toprovide detail for some of these industries. I guess the person I-42-2/3-4/94talked to at BLS was reading from this or had written this! One otherpoint I might make is that, looking at the manufacturing data, theworkweek remained at its recent high level. The workweek employmentincrease was in motor vehicles; outside of motor vehicles there wasn'tany gain. But overall this looks consistent with a moderate increasein industrial production. That's even allowing for what we thinkwould have been some loss during the month from the freeze and theearthquake.

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Don? If not, let me getstarted. Much of what I would usually say I stated in my testimony onMonday before the Joint Economic Committee, and I won't belabor any ofthat. The one issue that I didn't raise, except in a very minor way,is what I consider to be potentially dangerous upside problems in theinventory area. In looking at inventory/sales ratios, we tend tocombine wholesale, retail, and manufacturing at book value levels andput them in constant dollars. The interesting question that thisprocedure raises is, does this appropriately capture what is going on?And my answer to that is \"no.\" The reason the answer is no is thatwhat basically determines the relationship of orders, production,consumption, and the like are units of inventory. So, if you were totake the wholesale and retail inventory data, whose inventory/salesratios are trending upward much more than in manufacturing, strip outthe markups to put them back to factory level values and adjust themanufacturing data to factory level values, which is essentially athree major components. But since manufacturing has been going down,it all of a sudden has a big impact on the total. Even when you stripout work-in-process, what you get in terms of gross days' supply is aNow, the one thing we know about forecasting is that wheninventories go to zero, the rate of change cannot remain negative!There are models, incidentally, that don't necessarily have thatconstraint! But the reason I raise this question is that we're seeinga very tranquil inventory situation. The use of just-in-timeinventory management is becoming increasingly evident. The lead timeson the deliveries of materials ordered are flat and low. There hasbeen some minor increase in the delays of deliveries, which is usuallya sign of some tightening. But we have a very interesting problemhere: How far down can inventory/sales ratios continue to go?The forecast that we saw yesterday in the Chart Show showed agradual flattening out. The truth of the matter is that I don't knowhow they did it, but I know what they don't know. And what they don'tknow is what's going to happen to that particular ratio. If we beginto get any evidence of either a pickup in materials costs--and ananticipatory element is involved--or any evidence of a tightening oflead times on deliveries, which occurs when the operating rates beginto move up, purchasing managers will start to increase their inventoryrequirements. It is apocryphal that everyone's inventories now, intoday's computer regimes, are only in transit and that nobody hasanything. That may be partly true, but it can't be wholly truebecause there's still a huge amount of inventories sitting in variousplaces. Everyone may say that emergency stocks in the system rightnow are probably at the lowest level in history and the reason is thecomputer technology. But what I'm trying to get at here is that ifthere's one element of tranquility in our forecast, which wasgradually lulling us into considerable complacency, it's on theinventory side. That's basically what concerns me and what veryreadily could end up as the problem if suddenly we find that insteadof slipping back to 3 percent GPD growth, or 2-1/2 percent orsomething like that, the numbers stay up there. And the reason theywould stay up there is the same reason they've always stayed up in abusiness cycle expansion--that inventory accumulation turnsinventory/sales ratios higher, and that's ultimately a source of-44-2/3-4/94business cycle instability. That is a fact which has a great deal ofhistory associated with it.I am still puzzled by the fact that the balance sheets do notseem to be restraining activity by as much as I thought they would,considering the fact that they have not yet fully adjusted, if I mayput it that way. Clearly, balance sheet relationships are not back tothose typical of the mid-1980s and I always presumed that the desiredrelationships would be more conservative, considering what we wentthrough. That hypothesis is hard to hold in the context of what'sgoing on in purchasing and new orders, and I must say especially thequite a surprise. The chain store retail sales figures were weak,weaker than expected. However, the correlation that exists betweenthose data and total retail sales is very low, and I'm not even surethe sign is right. So really, those data don't tell us anything. Themotor vehicle sales are inputs into the GDP; they are real; theyinvolve full coverage; and they do not present any statisticalproblems of great moment.So, I concluded, as far as policy is concerned, that we areat the point where we finally have to start moving toward a somewhatless accommodative path. I think we have had an extraordinarilysuccessful run in restoring balance to a disturbed economic system.We haven't raised interest rates in five years, which is in itselfalmost unimaginable, especially in the context of strong economicconditions and historically low inflation. I must also say that thepresumption that inflation is quiescent is getting to be a slightlyshabby notion. We are seeing things like the purchasing managers'reports in January, which showed not a big spike in prices, but somespike. Listening to our roundtable discussion yesterday, I wasimpressed by the fact that labor shortages still were mentioned--notas a big deal but in a number of different areas--and that several ofyou cited some evidence that price increases are holding. So, whilewe may not find it in the broader price indexes, there was at least aninkling that the presumption that inflationary indicators are allquiescent is, as I said, sort of fraying at the seams. I don't knowwhat to make of this 0.7 increase in average hourly earnings. I tooka look at the details; it's basically in the services area;manufacturing is up 0.3 on straight-time earnings and 0.1 on average.That is consistent with part-timers going out of the system, giventhat their average rate is considerably below that of full-timeworkers. There may not be much there but, as Mike said, thepresumption that inflation is staying down is very hard to maintain.That doesn't necessarily mean anything; I suspect productivity isprobably doing better than we would expect and hence unit labor costsare not going up all that much.In any event, I would put on the table my preference that atthis meeting we move up 25 basis points. But if that's not the viewof the Committee, I would urge that we at least go asymmetric. ViceChairman.\n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believevery strongly that we should firm policy and that we should do sotoday and announce it today in the manner described in our lateafternoon conversation yesterday. Let me give some of the reasonsthat drive me to this conclusion. We are very near potential GDP and-45-2/3-4/94all of our forecasts, whether they are fine-tunings of the Greenbookor right on it, say that we will reach full potential this year. Thatwould mean that labor market pressures should show up relatively soonon a more generalized basis, and as the Chairman just described, theyalready are showing up in some areas of skilled labor. I agree thatan inventory cycle could well be at hand, especially in certain areaswhere there are resource constraints already--those involvingresidential construction, automobiles and light trucks, and homedurable goods.Therefore, it seems to me that the question is not so muchwhether we should tighten but by how much. And rather than comment onthe alternatives of an asymmetric directive and a move of 25 basispoints, let me evaluate my own view of whether the move should be 25or 50 basis points. Why would one think that a firming of 50 basispoints might be appropriate? Well, it might be deemed to be closer toa true adjustment away from what by our forecast is now excessiveaccommodation. However, I think there are two downside aspects to a50 basis point firming. First of all, it could be interpreted--and inmy own view would be interpreted by a fair number of marketparticipants--as a one-time fix, a one-time adjustment which would befollowed by a \"Fed-on-hold\" period. Secondly, I think it could bedeemed, especially in light of some of the discussion in this town andothers, a macho response, and I've always thought macho responsesconfused brains and bravado. A 25 basis point move, on the otherhand, I believe would send the right signal in the sense that theFederal Reserve, the central bank, is being watchful, as it should be.And we would be moving earlier in the economic cycle than the Fed hasdone historically and, therefore, we are doing our job even betterthan in the past. I think it would be interpreted as the first of aseries of moves and thus would be deemed, in my view, to be a strongersignal than a 50 basis point increase--if the 50 basis point increasewere seen, as I believe it would be, as a one-time adjustment to befollowed by the \"Fed on hold.\" So, I support the recommendation ofthe Chairman that we tighten. My own preference is for a 25 basispoint firming today.\n",

      "MR. MELZER. Well, as I stated yesterday, Alan, the stance ofmonetary policy has in my view been very expansionary for the last twoor three years. Accordingly, as I've also mentioned, the St. LouisBank expects that the CPI will move up sharply in 1994 and will moveeven higher in 1995. Indeed, as you mentioned, there may be someearly warning signs that the economy's disinflationary course hasalready come to an end. It is my view that we should act now toreduce the growth rate of reserves and M1 and signal this change witha 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate target. I favor50 basis points rather than a more modest amount at this juncture forthe following reasons: (1) I think the stage has been well set for achange in policy; (2) in my view we are late in acting; (3) too smalla policy shift may not convince markets of our resolve to keepinflation low; and (4) I suspect that each successive action couldbecome more difficult to take. That's my view on policy.Let me make just one other suggestion with respect to thelanguage in the directive where we describe economic and financialconditions. I would suggest that we include in that some mention of-46-2/3-4/94the behavior of M1, the adjusted monetary base and/or reserves overthe last year. I think that that may mitigate against some incorrectinterpretation of relatively weak M2 and M3 growth and what some mightthink that implies with respect to the thrust of monetary policy.That's all I have, Alan.\n",

Andafter listening to the discussion yesterday, it sounds to me as ifthat's true to some extent around most of the country now. For any ofyou who have ever tried either to pilot a light aircraft or sail asailboat, you know that trying to steer with a tail wind is much moredifficult and much more dangerous than with a head wind. And if welet tail winds build up, where we wind up on the course is moreproblematic. So, I think an adjustment now is appropriate. I wouldcome down on the side of 50 basis points even though Bill McDonough'sargument about that being viewed as a one-time adjustment followed bythe \"Fed on hold\" is interesting. The other side of that would bethat 25 basis points would be viewed clearly as the first of a seriesof moves. And if the market quickly built in pricing and expectationsof the next 25 basis point move, then the equilibrium rate would moveat least as much as our move, implying de facto that we easedconditions relative to where the market is if it's ahead of us. Idon't know what the timing might be as to market expectations, but ifit's a fairly short horizon--maybe no further out than the next FOMCmeeting--we may find that 25 was not enough to restrain reserve growthand that we would have been better going 50, or will need to give themthe other 25 fairly quickly.

I thoughtabout 50 basis points, or I thought about it in the sense of trying tomove the rate to where we want to put it and then sticking with it.But I think it may be very helpful to have anticipations in the marketnow that we are going to move rates higher because it will subduespeculation in the stock market; at this particular stage havingexpectations hanging in the market that we may move again, and movereasonably soon, could have a very useful effect. If it is in any waycontemplated that we have moved and are going to stop, that couldcreate the type of erosion in the economy that I've watched over thepast decades, which is precisely what we don't want. If we have thecapability of having a Sword of Damocles over the market we canprevent it from running away. If somebody suggested 50 basis pointsand then another 50 and then another 50, that's an argument Iunderstand and it's not inconsistent with my position. What I'm alittle concerned about is that a number people might expect thatthat's in fact what we are trying to do. If we're going to move, Iwould not mind moving again at the next meeting or the meeting afterthat, for example. That depends on the evolution of events, frankly.In order to simmer down this process, I think we should just verygradually tighten into it if the evidence suggests that that is wherewe should be going. On the question of whether it will become moredifficult to tighten, I presume that that means there are non-monetary-policy reasons for that, and I think this Committee has-47-2/3-4/94indicated no inclination to be affected by that.

There always areuncertainties; there always are reasons why we shouldn't make achange. But what I see is a self-feeding expansion and I thinkcapacity and price pressures are not all that far away. So, as far asthe economy goes, I think we need to move. On the credibility side,there's a time to talk, a time for speculation, and a time to act.We've talked, we've had speculation, and I think now is the time toact.I came into this meeting somewhat undecided between a 1/2 anda 1/4 point rate increase. I think there are some good reasons for a1/2 point move. It is more difficult to tighten than to ease, atleast it has been historically. So there is an advantage to gettingthe job done with fewer moves rather than more. Historically, thereis also the tendency to get behind the curve rather than stay ahead ofit. And I think a larger move does compensate for that risk. On theother hand, I do think that a 1/2 point move may be just too strong atthis point. There is a risk that we could appear too eager. I'veseen this Committee operate in the 1970s; I've seen it operate in the1980s and the 1990s; frankly, my confidence in our willingness andability to move promptly, to move as needed, is high enough that Ithink that a 1/4 point move makes sense. I also buy the notion thatit is important for the market to anticipate further moves. I thinkwe need to be forthcoming when that is called for. So, while historyand the risks do weigh heavily on my mind, on balance I come out infavor of a 1/4 point move and I support the symmetrical directive.

In terms of the amount, my preferencewould be for a 1/2 point move. At this stage of the game, given thesigns of strength in the economy and the evidence of some nascentupward price pressures in at least some places like the purchasingmanagers data, I worry that if we just do a 1/4 point at this junctureit's going to be seen as a rather timid move. I think there's somerisk that even after making that move, pretty shortly we will still bebehind the curve. A 1/2 point move, in contrast, would be a decisivemove. It would help us get out in front of this thing as it developsand would strengthen our position. And I guess I have a littledifficulty understanding the argument that that's going to create anexpectation that we are not going to move again for some time. Ibelieve those expectations would be determined by unfolding events.Also, it's worth noting that if we were to move the funds rate to3-1/2 percent on a nominal basis, the real funds rate would still bequite low and one could still make an argument that policy even thenwould be quite accommodative.

      "MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, this decision is not altogetherclear-cut in my mind. As a matter of fact, I view it as a difficultlittle, and that argument would revolve around the uncertainty in theeconomy. We certainly had a demand surge in the fourth quarter and itwould appear that that is going to continue to some extent. However,there is always the question before us as to whether that level ofactivity is going to continue. And I think the uncertainty isengendered by the income/debt ratios that we see, the uncertaintiessurrounding the economies of our trading partners, the question ofwhether capacity utilization rates given global competition are asmeaningful as they were, and the possible effects of fiscal policy--including the uncertainty surrounding the health plan which could beannounced, I suppose, before our next meeting. So, I think all ofthose things do present the case for staying where we are for themoment and waiting. I just want to make sure that we don't lose sightof those arguments. But I did indicate that it's a close call in myown mind, and on balance I think the arguments are more persuasive onthe other side by some marginal degree. So I would support moving atthis meeting. The credibility of the central bank is a very, veryimportant element at this time, and I think we will gain credibilityby moving now even though there might be some marginal risk that wemight have to reverse course. Clearly, there are signs that inflationis heating up a little, and we have to be vigilant about that. So, Iwould support your recommendation. I would go for 25 basis pointsbecause I think the gradual approach is better at this point, and Iwould support a symmetric directive.On the question of inflation, I would just put something onthe table, not for discussion now but as something that perhaps weought to think about. And that is that I, for one, am not reallyclear what our objective is with respect to inflation. We talk about-49-2/3-4/94price stability and lower inflation and inflation being quiescent andso on, but I don't know what our level of tolerance is, what we findacceptable as a Committee for inflation.

      "MR. LINDSEY. Well, if anything, I think the risks are thatwe are going to have do more than 150 basis points to lower the levelof inflation. I think the bias of the Committee is that if possiblewe want to bring inflation down a little more. Furthermore, the staffnoted today that GDP momentum seems stronger than they thought whenthey came up with the 150 basis point estimate. So, based on whatwe've learned since they did their forecast, it seems that the risksare on the up side, and that would suggest even more actions totighten. I appreciated very much Bill McDonough's analysis of the\"Fed on hold\" versus the first in a series of moves. If I think aboutit this way, though, what we are out to do is to minimize the effecton long-term growth, for a given amount of disinflation. If we go a1/4 point, we are telling the markets that this is the first in aseries and we're going to be raising rates over a long period of time.That would seem to me to be a signal that over an extended period oftime the average short-term rate is going to be higher than it wouldbe if we did it quickly. And since what affects long-term growth isequity prices and long-term bond prices, a slow gradual move--becauseit means on average higher long-term rates for a longer period--wouldbe more damaging to growth. So that would be another reason, I think,to move suddenly.Finally, I don't have any personal memories of it although Iwas alive at the time, the most successful Fed move against inflation,as I recall from what I read of history, was back in 1966. At firstthe data showed a recession then, but that recession was revised away.-50-2/3-4/94The Fed was able to overcome an inflationary condition by a short,sudden rise in interest rates. The downturn was actually not adownturn but simply a slowing in the rate of growth that lasted atmost six months and it brought the country another two years of highrates of economic expansion. I think the 1966 model is really what wewant to emulate today.\n",

On the question of magnitude, I have a mildpreference for a 50 basis point move basically on the grounds that Ibelieve short-term interest rates have to move pro-cyclically. A 1/4point increase at this point just doesn't seem to me to be an actionof much magnitude at all. My guess is not that it would get lost inthe markets--that certainly won't happen--but that it's not going toturn out to be significant relative to the job ahead of us. And ifI'm right that short-term rates have to move pro-cyclically, it seemsto me that we ought to get started. Therefore, as I said, I wouldhave a mild preference for a 50 basis point move.\n",

One difference is that we have somewhat greaterstrength in the early part of the period largely as a result of muchhigher nonfarm inventories than assumed in the Greenbook forecast.With regard to the amount of our move, I do favor 50 basis points.

      "MR. SYRON. Well, let me just continue. I think policy hasbeen stimulative but I don't think it has been inappropriatelystimulative. I don't want to argue about a month or five or six weeksone way or the other, but we went through a period in which we neededto do something. What we all want to do very clearly is to maximizelong-term growth in the economy, controlling real growth. As LarryLindsey said, controlling prices is a mechanism for doing that. Butthe reason we're concerned about prices is that we care about long-term real growth, not for some abstract reason. While there's nolong-term tradeoff, in the short term the way things work--at least inmy model--is that we can't avoid some lost output at the edges; andwhat we're trying to do is minimize that interval of lost output overtime. I'd be cautious about doing 50 basis points because I'm notsure that we have to raise rates 150 basis points. And at this pointI wouldn't want to start down a path with fairly fixed notions ofwhere I'm going at the end of it in terms of rates or in terms ofmonetary policy. I have a notion of where I want to get in terms of-52-2/3-4/94the economy, but not necessarily on what we need to do to get there.I think policy over time has been pretty effective. We're alreadywhat I might call orally asymmetric in a sense, given what theChairman did rather effectively in his testimony. I would stronglysuggest doing 25 basis points now with this accompanying change inprocess. And don't forget this will have a big announcement effectboth in the way it is done and the fact that we haven't done anythingin 17 months and we haven't tightened in 60 months. I would alsosuggest that it's not terribly long until the Humphrey-Hawkins hearingand there's going to be plenty of opportunity to be orally asymmetric,if I may use that phrase again, or to indicate how we see things. So,I think going 50 basis points would be depreciating a little too muchthe opportunity we're going to have to put this in context and may notbe fully taking into consideration the announcement effect of doing 25basis points and announcing it after this long a period of policyinaction.\n",

It does seem to me that there has been a very significantshift toward strength in the reports that we heard yesterday ascontrasted with December. But despite all that, I must say that someuncertainties still remain. Things are looking awfully good but thereare some questions that we've all talked about that still need to beanswered. So, I come down favoring 25 basis points. It does seem tome that 25 basis points with this announcement--which may turn out tobe precedential but at least this morning would be unprecedented--willhave a very strong signal effect. Therefore, I think in effect wewill get more than 25 basis points out of the action that wecontemplate. With regard to symmetry versus asymmetry--and this is adifferent thought--I've come to the conclusion that we ought to getrid of the asymmetric language forever. It seems to me to cause farmore complications than it's worth. If we are going to move,-54-2/3-4/94particularly over the foreseeable future, I think we ought to do it asa result of a conference call where we are all participating asopposed to getting all wrapped up in asymmetric language.

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You know, I rarely feel strongly aboutan issue, and I very rarely sort of press this Committee. But let metell you something about what's gnawing at me here. I am verysympathetic with the view that we've got to move and that we're goingto have an extended period of moves, assuming the changes that aregoing on now continue in the direction of strength. It is veryunlikely that the recent rate of economic growth will not simmer downlargely because some developments involved in this particular periodare clearly one-shot factors--namely, the very dramatic increase inresidential construction and the big increase in motor vehicle sales.Essentially the two of those have added one-shot elements to growth.In the context of a saving rate that is not high, the probability isin the direction of this expansion slowing from its recent pace, whichat the moment is well over 4 percent and, adjusting for weathereffects, may be running over 5 percent. This is not sustainablegrowth, and it has nothing to do with monetary policy. In otherwords, it will come down. And the way a 3 percent growth feels, if Ifeels now.I would be very concerned if this Committee went 50 basispoints now because I don't think the markets expect it. You want tohit a market when it needs to be hit; there is no significant evidenceat this stage of imbalances that require the type of action that anumber of us have discussed. Were we to go the 50 basis points withthe announcement effect and the shock effect, I am telling you thatthese markets will not hold still. I've been in the economicforecasting business since 1948, and I've been on Wall Street since1948, and I am telling you I have a pain in the pit of my stomach,which in the past I've been very successful in alluding to. I amtelling you--and I've seen these markets--this is not the time to dothis. I think there will be a time; and if the staff's forecast isright, we can get to 150 basis points pretty easily. We can do itwith a couple of 1/2 point jumps later when the markets are in theposition to know what we're doing and there's continuity. I reallyrequest that we not do this. I do request that we be willing to moveagain fairly soon, and maybe in larger increments; that depends on howthings are evolving.I also would be concerned if this Committee were not inconcert because at this stage we as a Committee are going to have todo things which the rest of the world is not going to like. We haveto do them because that's our job. If we are perceived to be split onan issue as significant as this, I think we're risking some veryserious problems for this organization. I don't think there is a-55-2/3-4/94philosophical difference anywhere around this room. If somebody askedme if I think there is an economic case for 50 basis points, my answeris \"most certainly there is a case.\" Do I think there is a case inthe full context of where the financial markets are at this stage andwhat the expectations in the markets are at this stage? I would sayemphatically \"no.\" It's far too risky. We don't need to take thoserisks.

It looks as if during the1980s we moved to a new secular plateau. We know what happened duringthat period: There was corporate restructuring in favor of debt forlots of reasons; there were lots of learned papers to explain thatdevelopment. Similarly, households moved toward debt. Not only havethose trends stopped in the corporate sector, but they are nowreversing themselves.

      "MR. KOHN. Going from 1993 to 1994, we have two specialfactors. One is the mortgage-backed securities situation, which added-61-2/3-4/94a couple percentage points to M1 in 1993 and will subtract a little in1994. We are assuming that the refinancings of mortgages will settledown or actually decline, and they have, and that subtracts fromdemand deposits. Number two is whichshifted a bunch of deposits, about $7 billion or so--we're not quitesure how much yet but in that order of magnitude--from NOW accounts toMMDAs. It doesn't affect M2, but we think that subtracted about 3/4of a percentage point from M1 growth. For M1 growth, when you go from1994 to 1995 the principal effect is interest rates. We've assumedthat the short-term interest rates consistent with the Greenbookforecast start on an upward trend in the second half of 1994 andcontinue that way through 1995. One thing we have found about M1 isthat it is a very interest-sensitive aggregate. There's the issue ofcompensating balances and the earnings effects, but even more so, Ithink, there's the issue of NOW accounts. When time deposit rates orrates, some of the funds that had been shifted into NOW accounts--because rates on NOW accounts and small time deposits were about thesame or not much different--may well be shifted back to time deposits.So, we think the NOW accounts in particular have become extremelyinterest sensitive. And that's why you see the velocity of M1--onChart 5--has become highly variable, especially after 1980. It'sbecause of the interest rate effects. Primarily what's happening,going from 1994 to 1995 in particular, is the effects of the risinginterest rates.\n",

I think that in fact if the Committee were to engage inthe tighter strategy--that is, raise rates higher now--it would end upreducing the funds rate in the out years. It just seemed like adegree of fine-tuning that perhaps wasn't needed. But we recognizedthe problem you're raising, which is that the real rate is rising outthere, and the Committee would have to bring it down. I think it isimportant to emphasize that to get the kind of disinflation embodiedin this scenario and without credibility effects--as we pointed outwe're just working off short-run and long-run Phillips curves--you doneed to keep the real interest rate a bit above its equilibrium levelin this tighter policy to keep slack in the economy, to keep theinflation rate pointed down. So, it's not surprising that the realrate in the tighter strategy is above the real rate in the baseline orthe real rate in the easier strategy; that corresponds to the variousunemployment rates in the model which you need to get the inflationrate---63-2/3-4/94\n",

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'd like to take a moment before weadjourn to note the impending retirement of one of the System's mostdistinguished economists, Dick Davis. During his 33 years at the NewYork Bank he's provided important service not only to that institutionbut to the System as a whole. Repeatedly when there was a major issueregarding monetary policy--for example, the role of the monetaryaggregates or what our operating procedures should be--we all lookedto Dick for leadership in our research efforts. Dick has alwaysexhibited an extraordinary ability to blend sophisticated, technicalanalysis with common sense and an understanding of institutionalrealities. In addition, he has been a model for all economists in theSystem. We thank you very much and wish you well in your futureendeavors. [Applause]\n",
