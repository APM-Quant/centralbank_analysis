      "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions improved somewhat further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing. Household spending is rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\n",

      "Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower energy prices and other factors, the Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.\n",

      "The Committee judges that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its current asset purchase program. Moreover, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability. Accordingly, the Committee decided to conclude its asset purchase program this month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\n",

      "To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.\n",

      "When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\n",

      "Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Stanley Fischer; Richard W. Fisher; Loretta J. Mester; Charles I. Plosser; Jerome H. Powell; and Daniel K. Tarullo. Voting against the action was Narayana Kocherlakota, who believed that, in light of continued sluggishness in the inflation outlook and the recent slide in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, the Committee should commit to keeping the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until the one-to-two-year ahead inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent and should continue the asset purchase program at its current level.\n",

Participants generally agreed that purchasing such securities could be a useful adjunct to other monetary policy tools in some circumstances. One participant preferred to begin purchasing Treasury securities immediately, as a way to increase the monetary base, in lieu of expanding programs that aim to support particular segments of the credit markets. Other participants were prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. However, they judged that purchases of longer-term Treasury securities would only modestly improve conditions in private credit markets at present, and that completing already-announced plans to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and to support certain asset-backed securities markets was, in current circumstances, likely to be a more effective way to employ the Federal Reserve balance sheet to support credit flows to, and spending by, households and businesses.\n",

As of January 26, the System's total assets and liabilities stood at just under $2 trillion, about $300 billion less than on December 17, 2008. The drop, which resulted primarily from a decline in foreign central bank drawings on reciprocal currency arrangements and a reduction in issuers' sales of commercial paper to the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), seemed to reflect some improvement in the functioning of global interbank markets and the commercial paper market after the year-end.\n",

Several indicated that they expected the soon-to-be-implemented Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to improve liquidity and reduce disruptions in the markets for securities backed by student loans, credit card receivables, auto loans, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; they also noted that it might become necessary to enhance or expand the TALF or other programs. However, in the view of one participant, financial markets--including those for asset-backed securities--were working reasonably well, given the current high level of pessimism and uncertainty about economic prospects and asset values, and the System's lending and asset-purchase programs were resulting in undesirable distortions in the allocation of credit. Others noted that such programs could have undesirable consequences if expanded too far or continued too long. Many participants agreed that it would be desirable for the System to develop additional measures of the effects of its programs, and they encouraged additional research on analytical frameworks that could inform Federal Reserve policy actions with respect to the size and composition of its balance sheet.\n",

      "Several meeting participants noted that the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet along with continued growth of the money supply could help stabilize longer-run inflation expectations in the face of increasing economic slack and very low inflation in coming quarters. Over a longer horizon, however, the Federal Reserve will need to scale back its liquidity programs and the size of its balance sheet as the economy recovers, to avoid the risk of an unwanted increase in expected inflation and a buildup of inflation pressures. Participants observed that many of the Federal Reserve's liquidity programs are priced so that they will become unattractive to borrowers as conditions in financial markets improve; these programs will shrink automatically. In other cases, the Federal Reserve eventually may have to take a more active role in scaling back programs by adjusting their terms and conditions. More generally, the Federal Reserve may need to develop additional tools to manage the size of its balance sheet and the level of the federal funds rate as the economy recovers. As of late January, however, with financial conditions strained and the economic outlook weak, most participants agreed that the Committee should continue to focus on supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy through purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other measures--including the implementation of the TALF--that will keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level for some time.\n",

Most expressed support for extending the termination dates in order to reassure market participants that the facilities would remain in place as a backstop to private-sector credit arrangements while financial conditions remained strained; they were prepared to extend the facilities beyond year-end if conditions warrant. Participants also noted that extending the termination date of these liquidity facilities to October 30 would not rule out the possibility of closing particular facilities sooner if improvements in financial conditions were to indicate they were no longer needed to support credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price stability.\n",

Conditions in the labor market continued to deteriorate rapidly in December: Private payroll employment fell sharply, and the unemployment rate rose.

Sales of existing single-family homes dropped less than sales of new homes in November and turned up in December, but the relative strength in sales of existing homes appeared to be at least partly attributable to increases in foreclosure-related and other distressed sales.

      "The decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at its December 15-16 meeting reportedly were more aggressive than investors had been expecting. Market participants reportedly were somewhat surprised both by the size of the reduction in the target federal funds rate, to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, and by the statements that policy rates would likely remain low for some time and that the FOMC might engage in additional nontraditional policy actions such as the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked down their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate, as measured by money market futures rates. The path first moved down immediately after the December FOMC meeting. Later in the period, the policy path tilted lower in response to weaker-than-expected economic data releases and increased concerns about the health of some financial institutions. In contrast, yields on medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury coupon securities increased, on net, over the period. Yields dropped sharply following the release of the FOMC statement, reportedly in part because investors interpreted it as suggesting that the Federal Reserve might increase its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities. Those price movements were more than reversed after the turn of the year, despite the worsening economic outlook, apparently reflecting a waning of year-end safe-haven demands and an anticipation of substantially increased Treasury debt issuance to finance larger-than-expected deficits associated with the new Administration's economic stimulus plans. Although implied inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) increased over the period, this increase reportedly was largely attributable to improved trading conditions in the TIPS market rather than upward revisions to inflation expectations.\n",

Conditions in the labor market deteriorated sharply over the intermeeting period. Industrial production declined steeply, and household and business spending fell more than anticipated. Sales and starts of new homes remained on a steep downtrend. Foreign demand also was weaker than expected. Financial markets continued to be strained overall, credit remained unusually tight for both households and businesses, and equity prices had fallen further. The staff's projections of real GDP growth in the second half of 2009 and in 2010 were revised upward slightly, reflecting greater monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as the effects of more moderate oil prices and long-term interest rates, but they continued to show no more than a gradual economic recovery. The staff again expected that unemployment would rise substantially through the beginning of 2010 before edging down over the remainder of that year. Forecasts for core and overall PCE inflation in 2009 and 2010 were little changed, with growth in both core and overall PCE prices expected to be unusually low over the next few years in response to slack in resource utilization and relatively flat prices anticipated for many commodities and for imports.\n",

      "In their discussion of the economic and financial situation and the outlook for the economy, participants agreed that the economy had weakened further going into 2009. The incoming data, as well as information received from contacts in the business and banking communities, indicated a sharp and widespread economic contraction both domestically and abroad, reflecting in large part the adverse effects of the intensification of the financial crisis and the interaction between deteriorating economic and financial conditions. Participants generally saw credit conditions as extremely tight, with financial markets fragile and some parts of the banking sector under substantial stress. However, modest signs of improvement were evident in some financial markets--particularly those that were receiving support from Federal Reserve liquidity facilities and other government actions. Participants anticipated that a gradual recovery in U.S. economic activity would begin during the third or fourth quarter of this year as the economy begins to respond to fiscal stimulus, relatively low energy prices, and continuing efforts to stabilize the financial sector and increase the availability of credit. Several participants noted that firms' efforts to control inventories as sales declined had contributed to the rapid downturn in production and employment in recent quarters, but expected that the resulting absence of widespread inventory overhangs might spur a prompt pickup in production in many sectors later this year once sales begin to level out or turn up. Headline inflation would pick up some as the effects of previous declines in oil and other commodity prices wore off. But in an environment of considerable economic slack, little if any inflation pressure from energy or other import prices, and possible declines in inflation expectations, headline and core inflation were expected to be quite low for several years. Participants were, however, quite uncertain about the outlook. All but a few saw the risks to growth as tilted to the downside; in light of financial stresses and tight credit conditions, they saw a significant risk that the economic recovery would be both delayed and initially quite weak.

Looking ahead, participants anticipated that tax cuts and some other elements of the proposed fiscal stimulus package would add to after-tax incomes and thus boost consumer spending, though the magnitude of the impetus was far from clear.

Several others, however, anticipated that longer-run inflation expectations would remain well anchored, supported in part by the Federal Reserve's aggressive expansion of its balance sheet and the resulting growth of the monetary base, and therefore thought it unlikely that inflation would decline below levels they saw as consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment.

      "Conference CallOn January 16, 2009, the Committee met by conference call to discuss issues associated with establishing an explicit numerical objective for inflation. The Committee made no decisions on whether to establish such an objective. Most meeting participants expressed the view that an explicit numerical objective for longer-run inflation would be fully consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability and would not impede fostering the stability of the financial system. A number of participants emphasized that additional clarity on the longer-run inflation goal would further enhance Federal Reserve communications but would not involve any substantive change in monetary policy strategy. Many participants agreed that establishing and maintaining a transparent numerical inflation objective would be helpful--at least to some degree--in anchoring inflation expectations and thereby improve the overall effectiveness of monetary policy; others judged that the potential benefits of an explicit numerical inflation objective might be largely attained by extending the horizon of their regular projections for economic activity and inflation. Some indicated that the establishment of a numerical inflation objective could be particularly helpful under present circumstances in forestalling an unwelcome decline in longer-run inflation expectations---and hence in contributing to economic recovery--while also assuring the public that actions taken to counter economic weakness will not lead to high inflation over the longer-run. However, several participants expressed concern that an initiative to clarify the Committee's longer-run inflation objective could be confusing to the public in the current context of economic weakness and financial market strains. Participants also discussed several technical issues related to the implementation and communication of an explicit numerical inflation objective. They expressed a range of views about whether such an objective should be expressed in terms of the consumer price index or the PCE price deflator, the merits of a point value versus a range, the length of time over which policy would aim to achieve any such objective, and the frequency with which the Committee would reevaluate this framework. At this meeting, the staff also briefed the Committee on the coordinated set of measures for supporting Bank of America that had been taken by the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve earlier that day.\n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open our policy strategy.  I will then be glad to take your questions.   As indicated in its statement, the Committee decided today to maintain the policies that were initiated at previous meetings.  In particular, the Committee is keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue the program that we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treasury securities.  Our purchases of longer-term securities exert downward pressures on longer-term interest rates; at the same time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of our sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest rates.  Consequently, this maturity extension program should foster more accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping support a stronger recovery without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our previously announced program in which the principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities are being reinvested in agency MBS.  The Committee regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings, and we are prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.   2 of 22  In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer run.  The central tendencies and ranges of those projections are depicted in the figures that have been distributed.  The longer-run projections—shown at the right side of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over time, assuming appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy.   The longer-run projections for growth of real GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to 2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  These projections can be interpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run.  Because the economy's longer- run normal rates of output growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and that cannot often be directly measured, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision.   The central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  The inflation outlook over the longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections essentially reflect participants’ judgments about the inflation rate that is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices.  In effect, the “mandate-consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  Participants’ projections for real GDP for 2011 as a whole have a central tendency of 1.6 to 1.7 percent.  Output growth strengthened during the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on 3 of 22  growth earlier in the year.  In particular, global supply chain disruptions associated with the natural disaster in Japan have diminished.  Moreover, the prices of oil and other commodities have come down from their peaks, easing strains on household budgets and contributing to a somewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months.   The Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses, volatility in financial markets, fiscal consolidation at all levels of government, and other factors.  Looking further ahead, economic growth is expected to pick up somewhat as a result of improving financial conditions, strengthening consumer and business confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ growth projections picks up gradually from 2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014.   In light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quarters.  Participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of 8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ percentage point lower than the latest monthly reading of 9.1 percent.  The unemployment rate is expected to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.   In short, while we still expect that economic activity and labor market conditions will improve gradually over time, the pace of progress is likely to be frustratingly slow.  Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  Most notably, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which 4 of 22  have likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth.  European leaders have recently announced a number of steps to address those issues.  We will continue to monitor European developments closely.   I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.  The prices of oil and other commodities rose sharply earlier this year.  Consumer inflation consequently picked up over the first half of 2011, reflecting higher prices of gasoline, food, and other goods and services for which producers passed higher input costs along to their customers.  In addition, prices of motor vehicles surged in response to the global supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan.  However, inflation appears to have moderated as those transitory influences have waned, and as low levels of resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages.  Furthermore, survey measures and Consequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle at or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent or a bit less.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014.  The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.   The current economic outlook provides important context for understanding today’s policy decision.  The Committee’s mandate from the Congress is to seek maximum employment and price stability.  With unemployment well above normal levels and expected to decline only slowly, and with inflation expected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the Committee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.  We will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming 5 of 22  information, and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.   Finally, I would like to note that the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy public communications.  Specifically, we have been engaging in a series of discussions about potential approaches to providing the public additional information about our monetary policy goals and policy strategy, as well as about our outlook for the economy and for the future stance of monetary policy.  However, no decisions about such approaches were made at this meeting.   Thank you for your patience, and I would be happy to take your questions.   \n",

      "STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, over the past several months, it seems there’s been increasing criticism of the Fed’s policy.  You received a letter on the eve of the September meeting urging you not to take action from the GOP leadership.  Several GOP presidential candidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates.  On the first issue, do you feel that crossed the line?  Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed’s independence?  On the second question, what are the GOP presidential candidates not hearing or understanding about Fed policy, in your opinion?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to stay nonpartisan and out of those debates.  I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longer term, in the short term, it’s very important that the Fed be free from political pressures.  And therefore, we are going to make our decisions based on what’s good for the economy, and we’re not going to take any politics into account.   6 of 22  Now, the concerns that have been expressed relate to the possibility that the Fed’s highly expansionary policies might be contributing to inflation risk.  I would simply point to the record.  If you look back for the last five years, inflation—although it’s been volatile because of commodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area where we have fallen short, obviously, is on the unemployment side.  So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to be very valid.   \n",

We have a mandate for both employment and for price stability, and we have a framework in place that allows us to communicate and to think about the two sides of that mandate.  We talked today—or yesterday, actually—about nominal GDP as an indicator, as an information variable, as something to add to the list of variables that we think about, and it was a very interesting discussion.  However, we think that within the existing framework that we have, which looks at both sides of the mandate, not just some combination of the two, we can communicate whatever we need to communicate about future monetary policy.  So we are not contemplating at this 7 of 22  date—at this time—any radical change in framework.  We are going to stay within the dual-mandate approach that we’ve been using until this point.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I’ve said before, I certainly understand that many people are dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  I’m dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  Unemployment is far too high.  Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been going on—increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that has continued, we now have a more unequal society than we’ve had in the past.  So again, I fully sympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be, and in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectrum are understandable.   I think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions.  The Federal Reserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the financial system in 2008 and 2009.  A very simplistic interpretation of that was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve, you know, bankers’ salaries.  That is obviously not the case.  What we were doing is trying to protect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collapse of both the financial system and the American economy.  We needed to take those steps.  If we hadn’t taken them, the consequences would have been dire.  And not everybody understands that, and therefore they sometimes misunderstand our motives.  Our motives are strictly to do what’s in the interest of 8 of 22  the broad public, and I believe that our efforts to stabilize the financial system, which ultimately proved successful, were very much in the interest of the broad public.   With respect to the current economy, as I described earlier, we are currently continuing with our accommodative monetary policy.  We are trying to do our best to support economic growth and job creation.  I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from some other parts of the government to work with us, to help create more jobs.  But certainly, we are doing our part to try to create more jobs and more opportunities in America.   With respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs.  It gives people opportunities.  It gives people a chance to earn income, gain experience, and to ultimately earn more.  But that’s an indirect approach; that’s really the only way the Fed can address inequality per se.   \n",

I think it’s clear that—in retrospect, that the severity of the financial crisis and a number of other problems, including the dysfunction of the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than we initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by the household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery.  So, yes, we have again downgraded the medium-term forecast.  Evidently, the forces—you know, the drags on the recovery were stronger than we thought.   I would add, however, though, that although I think it’s very important to look at the fundamental factors affecting the recovery, there’ve been some elements of bad luck.  For example, this year, the combination of the natural disaster in Japan which had global impacts in terms of growth, oil price increases, the European debt crisis, which was not anticipated to be as severe and create as much volatility as it has in financial markets—all those things have been negatives for growth, and they do explain at least part of the downward revision.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, it’s a fair question.  I would first say that monetary policy is having effects on the economy.  And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.  One area where monetary policy has been blunted—the effects have been blunted—has been the mortgage market, where very tight credit standards have prevented many people from purchasing or refinancing their homes, and therefore the low mortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been as effective as we had hoped.  So, monetary policy may be somewhat less powerful in the current context than it has been in the past, but nevertheless, it is affecting economic growth and job creation.   If you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one, which is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the problems of high inflation but also very importantly has avoided the risk of deflation.  And we’ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem and very difficult to get out of once you are there.  So we have been able to achieve, on average, stable prices.   With respect to growth, I think that our policies, including the cutting of rates to zero in were very important for helping to explain why the economy stopped contracting and began to grow again in the middle of 2009.  I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth and job creation.  I would argue that we’ve also been successful with some of the later actions that we’ve taken, although it’s early to say for things like the maturity extension program, but we 14 of 22  always face the problem of asking the question, Well, where would we be without these policies?  And our best estimates are that—absent the support of monetary policy, that the economy would be in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher than it is.  That being said, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to where we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable.  Yes, I do think that with—you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price stability and maximum employment.  We’ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have are efficacious and that they don’t have costs or risks or negative side effects that are worse than the benefits.

But that being said, as I indicated earlier, there has been a certain amount of bad luck, and I think the volatility in financial markets associated with the European situation has been—along with volatility associated with the U.S. fiscal conditions, has been a drag on recovery.  I think it’s part of the reason why the second half of 2011 was less strong than we anticipated when I was here at the last press conference in June.  So there has been that concern.  It’s showing up in Americans’ 18 of 22  confidence and sentiment.  You can see that right now consumer confidence is about where it was in the depths of recession; that’s very discouraging.  To some extent, at least, it will be a drag on consumer’s willingness to spend and to invest.   My best advice to Americans is to continue to live your lives, though, and to continue to think about your personal situation and try to make smart decisions based on your own financial position.  Clearly, Americans are trying to improve their balance sheets; they’re trying to pay down debt.  That’s, of course, important.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation.  We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—that is, unemployment arising because of inadequate demand in the economy.  If that’s the case, then a monetary policy—by lowering interest rates, making financial conditions more accommodative—should stimulate demand, should stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical unemployment.  That is something that we know from a lot of experience, and, although it’s been a very slow process here, there’s no reason to think that the same basic effect will not work in this case as well.   Now, it’s also possible that part of the increase in unemployment reflects so-called structural factors—mismatches between worker skills and job opportunities, loss of skills, geographical mismatch, et cetera.  And to the extent that that’s the case, then monetary policy is much less effective because in that case, only other kinds of labor market policies really can make progress against that type of unemployment.  But again, I do think that a considerable part of the unemployment that we are seeing is cyclical and is thus amenable to monetary policy. 22 of 22  Final comment:  Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can become structural unemployment as people lose skills, as they lose attachment to the labor force, as their work networks dry up and so on.  So in that respect, it’s important for us to try to address the unemployment problem in a sense while it’s still amenable to monetary policy.   \n",

      "BRAIMOH ODION-ESENE.  Braimoh Odion-Esene, Market News International.  You mentioned that the Fed has the tools and stands ready to use it.  But given that in the statement it says that the Committee saw growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, is it fair to say that the FOMC is less aggressively considering more policy accommodation, given the improvement they saw in the third quarter?   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We did see some improvement in the third quarter, a modest improvement.  We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventories, therefore suggesting more production in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter as well will be a moderate-growth quarter.  So there was some improvement—some improvement, at least early in the period, in financial acknowledging in our statement, that’s true.  But as has been noted, the medium-term outlook relative to our June projections has been downgraded, and the outlook remains unsatisfactory over the next few years.  And we’ll continue to ask ourselves whether or not additional stimulus or additional actions can provide a better outcome, and that’s certainly something that remains on the table and we’ll continue to evaluate as we go forward.   Thank you.\n"

I’ll then be glad to take your questions.  Throughout today’s briefing, my goal will be to reflect the consensus of the Committee, while taking note of the diversity of views as appropriate.  Of course, my remarks and interpretations are my own responsibility.   In its policy statement released earlier today, the Committee announced, first, that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings, and, second, that it will complete its planned purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.  Of course, going forward, the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to meet the Federal Reserve’s mandate.   The Committee made no change today in the target range of the federal funds rate, which remains at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.   2 of 26  In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.  These projections are conditional on each participant’s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives.  A table showing the projections has been distributed.  I’m going to focus today on the central tendency projections, which exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.   I call your attention, first, to the Committee’s longer-run projections, which represent participants’ assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy.  As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey.  The longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in normal, or trend, rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run, respectively.  The economy’s longer-term rate of growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of technological change, and it should be noted that estimates of these rates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision over time.   The central tendency of the longer-run projection for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  In contrast to economic growth and unemployment, the longer-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by monetary policy; consequently, and given that these projections are based on the assumption that 3 of 26  monetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that Committee participants judge to be most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices.  At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the “mandate-consistent” rate of inflation is greater than zero for a number of reasons.  Perhaps most important, attempting to maintain inflation at zero would increase the risk of experiencing an extended bout of deflation, or falling wages and prices, which in turn could lead employment to fall below its maximum sustainable level for a protracted period.  Hence, a goal of literally zero inflation is not consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, most central banks around the world aim to set inflation above zero, usually at about 2 percent.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  As indicated in today’s policy statement, the Committee sees the economic recovery as proceeding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and investment in equipment and software continue to expand, supporting the recovery, but nonresidential investment is still weak and the housing sector is depressed.  In the labor market, overall conditions continue to improve gradually.  For example, the unemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employment increased in March; new claims for unemployment insurance and indicators of hiring plans are also consistent with continued improvement.   Looking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projected for 2012 and 2013.  Specifically, as the table shows, participants’ projections for output growth have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent for this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013.  These projections are a little below those made by the Committee in January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in particular reflects the somewhat slower-than-anticipated pace of growth in the first quarter.   4 of 26  The outlook for above-trend growth is associated with a projected reduction in the unemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to 8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to 5.6 percent.  The projected decline in the unemployment rate is relatively slow largely because economic growth is projected to be only modestly above the trend growth rate of the economy.   On the inflation front, commodity prices have risen significantly recently, reflecting geopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors.  Increases in commodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation.  However, measures of underlying inflation, though having increased modestly in recent months, remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  Consequently, the Committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity prices to be transitory; as the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflation should decline toward its underlying level.  Specifically, participants’ projections for inflation have a central tendency of 2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year, noticeably higher than in the January projections, before declining to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013—both about the same as in January.   The Committee’s economic projections provide important context for understanding today’s policy action as well as the Committee’s general policy strategy.  Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the likely future course of the economy.  Thus the Committee’s projections of the economy, not just current conditions alone, must guide its policy decisions.  The lags with which monetary policy affects the economy also imply that the Committee must focus on meeting its mandated objectives over the medium term, which can be as short as a year or two but may be longer, 5 of 26  depending on how far the economy is initially from conditions of maximum employment and price stability.   To foster maximum employment, the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient economic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level.  At 8.8 percent, the current unemployment rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward more normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow.  The substantial ongoing slack in the labor market and the relatively slow pace of improvement remain important reasons that the Committee continues to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy.   In the medium term, the Committee also seeks to achieve a mandate-consistent inflation rate, which participants’ longer-term projections for inflation suggest is 2 percent or a bit less.  Although the recent surge in commodity prices has led inflation to pick up somewhat in the near term, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the medium term, as I have discussed.  Consequently, the short-term increase in inflation has not prompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture.  Importantly, however, the Committee’s outlook for inflation is predicated on longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expect inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased commodity prices are unlikely to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages.  Thus, besides monitoring inflation itself, the Committee will pay close attention to inflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects.   In providing extraordinary monetary policy accommodation in the aftermath of the crisis, the Committee has not only reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a very low level, but has also expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet substantially.  The Committee at this 6 of 26  meeting continued its ongoing discussion of the available tools for removing policy accommodation, at such time as that should become appropriate.  The Committee remains confident that it has the tools that it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that economic conditions warrant such a step.  And in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that normalization, we will carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.   Thank you again, and I’d be glad to take your questions.   \n",

      "QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we’re going to get a pretty weak first-quarter GDP number.  Your own projections for the year have been downgraded in this meeting.  How—first of all, what do you see as the causes of the weak growth to start the year, even with monetary easing, even with payroll tax cuts?  And what’s behind this weaker forecast for 2011 GDP?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You’re correct.  We haven’t seen the GDP number yet.  But we, like most private-sector forecasters, are expecting a relatively weak number for the first quarter, maybe something a little under 2 percent.  Most of the factors that account for the slower growth in the first quarter appear to us to be transitory.  They include things like, for example, lower defense spending than was anticipated, which will presumably be made up in a later quarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick up again; and other factors like weather and so on.  Now, there are some factors there that may have a longer-term implication.  For example, construction, both residential and nonresidential, was very weak in the first quarter, and that may have some implications going forward.  So I would say that, roughly, that most of the slowdown in the first quarter is viewed by the Committee as being transitory.  That being said, we’ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking 7 of 26  into account factors like—like weaker construction and possibly just a bit less momentum in the economy.   \n",

Mr. Chairman, given what you know about the pace of the economy now, what is your best guess for how soon the Fed needs to begin to withdraw its extraordinary stimulus for the economy?

      "\n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, currently as the statement suggests, we are in a moderate recovery.  We’ll be looking very carefully, first, to see if that recovery is, indeed, sustainable, as we believe it is.  And we’ll also be looking very closely at the labor market.  We’ve seen improvement in the labor market in the first quarter relative to the latter part of last year, but we’d like to see continued improvement—more job creation going forward.  At the same time, we’re also looking very carefully at inflation, the other part of our mandate.  As I’ve noted, inflation—headline inflation—is at least temporarily higher, being driven by gasoline prices and some other commodity prices.  Our expectation is that—that inflation will come down towards a more normal level.  But we’ll be watching that carefully and also watching inflation expectations, which—you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we’re going to see inflation remain under good control.  So to answer your question, I don’t know exactly how long it will be before a tightening process begins.  It’s going to depend obviously on the outlook and on those criteria which I suggested.  The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points:  “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.  Once those conditions are violated, or are we moving away from those conditions, that will be the time that we need to begin to tighten.  “Extended period” suggests that there would be a couple of meetings probably before—before 8 of 26  action.  But, unfortunately, the reason we use this vaguer terminology is that we don’t know with certainty how quickly response will be required, and, therefore, we will do our best to communicate changes in our view as—but that will depend entirely on how the economy evolves.   \n",

First, I should start by saying that the Secretary of the Treasury, of course, is the spokesperson for U.S. policy on the dollar and Secretary Geithner had some words yesterday.  Let me just add to what he said, first, by saying that the Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is both in American interest and in the interest of the global economy.  There are many factors that cause the dollar to move up and down over short periods of time.  But over the medium term, where our policy is aimed, we’re doing two things.  First, we are trying to maintain low and stable inflation by our definition of price stability by maintaining the purchasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation low.  That’s obviously good for the dollar.  The second thing we’re trying to accomplish is to get a stronger recovery and to achieve maximum employment.  And, again, a strong economy, growing, with attracting foreign capital, is going to be good for the dollar.  So in our view, if we do what’s needed to pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, that will also generate fundamentals that will help the dollar in the medium term.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the dollar—the dollar fluctuates.  One factor, for example, that has caused fluctuations that have been quite extreme during the crisis has been the safe-haven effect.  So, for example, during the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008, money flowed in to the Treasury market and drove up the value of the dollar quite substantially, reflecting the fact that U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world.  And a lot of what you’ve seen over the last couple of years is just the unwinding of that as the economy has strengthened and as uncertainty has—has been reduced.  But that’s indicative, I think, of the—of the high standing that the dollar still retains in the world.  Again, ultimately, the best thing we can do to create strong fundamentals for the dollar in the medium term is to, first, keep inflation low, which maintains the buying power of the dollar, and, second, to create a strong economy.   \n",

      "QUESTION.  Chairman, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Many Americans are upset that gasoline prices are rising so fast and that food prices are also going up.  Can you talk about whether there’s anything that the Fed can or should do about that?  And can you also comment or elaborate on the increase that we’ve seen in the inflation forecasts that the Fed put out today?  \n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  Thanks, Jon.  So, first of all, gasoline prices obviously have risen quite significantly.  And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that higher gas prices are absolutely creating a great deal of financial hardship for a lot of people.  And gas, of course, is a necessity.  People need to drive to get to work.  So it’s obviously a very bad development to see gas prices rise so much.  Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make economic developments less favorable.  On the one hand, obviously, the higher gas prices add to inflation.  On the other hand, by draining purchasing power from households, higher gas prices 10 of 26  are also bad for the recovery.  They cause growth to decline as well.  So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.  Now, our—our interpretation of the increase in gas prices is the economist’s basic mantra of supply and demand.  On the one hand, we have a rapidly growing global economy.  Emerging market economies are growing very quickly, and their demand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong.  Indeed, essentially all of the increase in the demand for oil in the last couple of years and the last decade has come from emerging market economies.  In the United States, our demand for oil—our imports have actually been going down over time.  So the demand is coming from a growing economy where we’ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emerging market output in the last—since before the crisis.  And on the supply side, as everybody knows who watches television, we’ve seen disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa, in Libya, and in other places that have constrained supply. That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up quite significantly.  So, again, this is a very adverse development.  It accounts in the short run for the increase in our—pretty much almost all of the increase in our inflation forecast, at least in the very near term.  There’s not much the Federal Reserve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which is certainly not the right way to go.  After all, the Fed can’t create more oil.  We don’t control the growth rates of emerging market economies.  What we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a broader inflation, which would be much more difficult to extinguish.  Again, our view is that, most likely—of course, we don’t know for sure, but we’ll be watching carefully—our view is that gas prices will not continue to rise at the recent pace, and as they stabilize or even come down if the situation stabilizes in the Middle East, that that will provide some relief on the inflation front.  But we’ll have to watch it very carefully.   11 of 26  \n",

And we’d just like to make sure that that is sustainable, and the longer it goes on, the more confident we are.  And, again, it is encouraging to see the improvement that we’ve seen in recent months.  That being said, the pace of improvement is still quite slow, and we are digging ourselves out of a very, very deep hole.  We are still something like 7 million-plus jobs below where we were before the crisis.  And so, clearly, the fact that we’re moving in the right direction, even though that’s encouraging, doesn’t mean that the labor market is in good shape.  Obviously, it’s not.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, the inflation expectations that we are concerned about are medium-term inflation expectations.  So we’ve seen, for example, in the financial markets, in the indexed bond market, for example, or in surveys like the Michigan survey, we’ve seen near-term inflation expectations rise fairly significantly, which is reasonable given higher commodity prices, higher gas prices.  But for the most part, although there’s been some movement here and there, for the most part, I think it’s fair to say that medium-term inflation expectations have not really moved very much, and they still indicate confidence that the Fed will ensure that inflation in the medium term will be close to what I’ve called the mandate-consistent level.  What can we do?  In the short run, we can communicate and try to make sure the public understands what our policy is attempting to do, to be clear what our objectives are and what steps we’re willing to take to meet those objectives.  Ultimately, if—if inflation persists or if inflation expectations begin to move, then there’s no substitute for action.  We would have—we would have to respond.  I think—while it is very, very important for us to try to help the economy create jobs and to support the recovery, I think every central banker understands that keeping inflation low and stable is absolutely essential to a successful economy.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  As I—as I’ve noted and as you’re all aware, we are—we are going to complete the program at the end of the second quarter, $600 billion.  We are going to do that pretty much without tapering.  We’re just going to let the purchases end.  Our view is that—based on past experience and based on our analysis—is that the end of the program is unlikely to have significant effects on financial markets or on the economy, the reason being that, first—just a simple point that we hoped we have telegraphed today—we hope we have communicated what we’re planning to do.  And the markets have well anticipated this step.  And you would expect that policy steps which are well anticipated by the market would have relatively small effects because whatever effects you’re going to have would have already been capitalized in the financial markets.  Secondly, we subscribe generally to what we call here the stock view of the effects of securities purchases, which—by which I mean that what matters primarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather the size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserve holds.  And so, when we complete the program, as you noted, we are going to continue to reinvest maturing securities, both Treasuries and MBS, and so the amount of securities that we hold will remain approximately constant.  Therefore, we shouldn’t expect any major effect of that.  Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy easing, should essentially remain constant going forward from—from June.  At some point, presumably early in our exit process, we will, I suspect, based on conversations we’ve been having around the FOMC table, it’s very likely that an early step would be to stop reinvesting all or part of the securities which are coming—which are maturing.  But take note that that step, although a relatively modest step, does constitute a policy tightening because it would be lowering the size of our balance sheet and, therefore, would be expected to essentially tighten financial conditions.  That being said, we therefore have to make that decision based on the 14 of 26  outlook, based on our view of how sustainable the recovery is and what the condition—the situation is respect to inflation.  So we will base that decision on the evolving outlook. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I should say, first of all, that, in terms of trying to help this economy stabilize and then recover, the Federal Reserve has undertaken extraordinary measures.  Those include, obviously, all the steps we took to stabilize the financial system during the crisis—again, many of which were extraordinary measures taken under extreme circumstances.  Even beyond the steps we took to stabilize the system, we have created new ways to ease monetary policy.  We’ve brought the federal funds rate target close to zero.  We have used forward guidance in our language to affect expectations of policy changes.  And, of course, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term securities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing financial conditions and, therefore, providing support for recovery and for employment.  Going forward, we’ll have to continue to make judgments about whether additional steps are warranted.  But as we do so, we have to keep in mind that we do have a dual mandate, that we do have to worry about both the rate of growth but also the inflation rate.  And as I was indicating earlier, I think that—even purely from an employment perspective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise significantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant.  And so we do have to make sure 15 of 26  that we are paying adequate attention to both sides of our mandate.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Well, first, I do believe that the second round of securities purchases was effective.  We saw that first in the financial markets.  The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions.  And we saw increases in stock prices.  We saw reduced spreads in credit markets.  We saw reduced volatility.  We saw all the changes in financial markets and quite significant changes that one would expect if one was doing an ordinary easing of policy via a reduced federal funds rate.  And, indeed, we saw the same types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009.  So we were able to get the financial easing that we were trying to get.  We did get very significant easing from this program.  You would expect, based on decades of experience, that easing financial conditions would lead to better economic conditions, and I think the evidence is consistent with that as well.  As I discussed in more detail in my Humphrey–Hawkins testimony in the beginning of March, between late August when I first indicated that the Federal Reserve was seriously considering this additional step and early this year, not only the Federal Reserve but many outside forecasters upgraded their forecasts.  And we saw—we saw strengthening labor that the second round of securities purchases was ineffective could only be validated if one thought that this—this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return 16 of 26  us to full employment overnight.  We were very clear from the beginning that, while we thought this was an important step and that it was at an important time when we were all worried about a double dip and we were worried about deflation, we were very clear that this was not going to be a panacea, that it was only going to turn the economy in the right direction.  And, indeed, we published some analytics which gave job creation numbers which were significant but not—certainly not enough to completely solve the enormous jobs problem that we have.  So, again, relative to what we expected, anticipated, I think the program was successful.  Why not do more?  Again, this was similar to the question I received earlier.  The tradeoffs are getting—are getting less attractive at this point.  Inflation has gotten higher.  Inflation expectations are a bit higher.  It’s not clear that we can get substantial improvements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk.  And, in my view, if we’re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we’ve got to keep inflation under control.  So we’ve got to look at both of those—both parts of the mandate as we—as we choose policy.   \n",

So, as we look at oil prices, you know, as you point out, we have to look at both sides of the situation.  I do think that one of the key things that we’ll be looking at will be inflation expectations because, if medium-term 17 of 26  inflation expectations remain well anchored and stable so that firms are not passing on—at least on an ongoing, sustained basis—these higher costs into broader prices, into creating a broader inflation in the economy, as long as inflation expectations are well—are well stabilized, that won’t happen, then we’ll feel more comfortable just watching and waiting and seeing how things evolve.  Again, if we fear that inflation expectations look like they’re becoming less anchored, we would have to respond to that.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first, you’re absolutely right.  Long-term unemployment in the current economy is—is the worst—really the worst it’s been in the postwar period.  Currently something like 45 percent of all the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or longer.  And we know the consequences of that can be very distressing because people who are out of work for a long time, their skills tend to atrophy—they lose contacts with the labor market, with other people working, the networks that they have built up.  And we saw in the European experience, for example, in the ’80s and ’90s, that a period of high unemployment with very long-term unemployment spells can actually lead unemployment to remain very high for a protracted period.  So it is a very significant concern.  And it’s one of the reasons that—that the Federal Reserve has been so aggressive.  By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.  So that’s part of the reason that we have been as aggressive as we have.  As the situation drags on and as the long-term unemployed lose skills and lose contact with the labor 18 of 26  of the scope of monetary policy.  At that point, job training, education, and other types of interventions would probably be more effective than monetary policy. \n",

Well, in one sense, S&P’s action didn’t really tell us anything because everybody who reads the newspaper knows that the United States has a very serious long-term fiscal problem.  That being said, I’m hopeful that this event will provide at least one more incentive for Congress and the Administration to—to address this problem.  I think it’s the most important economic problem, at least in the longer term, that the United States faces.  We currently have a fiscal deficit which is simply not sustainable over the longer term.  And if it’s not the addressed, it will have significant consequences for financial stability, for economic growth, and for our standard of living.  It is encouraging that we are seeing efforts on both sides of the aisle to think about this issue from a long-run perspective.  It’s not a problem 19 of 26  that can be solved by making changes only for the next six months.  It’s really a long-run issue.  We’re still a long way from a solution, obviously.  But it is, I think, of the highest importance that our political leaders address this very difficult problem as quickly and as effectively as they can.

In the past, there have been times when fiscal policy has tightened, and the Federal Reserve has chosen to ease its policy in response partly to that, given whatever the circumstances in the economy were at the time.  Congress appears intent at this point in cutting spending significantly; it might restrain the economy as it appears to be doing in Britain where they’re following a similar path.  Is there anything the Fed can do or should do if, indeed, there are large budget cuts sometime in the next 18 months?  \n",

And nothing I would want to say would be—should be construed as saying that I think it’s anything other than a top priority.  It’s very, very important that our leaders address this—address this issue.  I would also say that the cuts that have been made so far don’t seem to us to have very significant consequences for short-term economic activity.  Now, my preference in terms of addressing the—the long-term deficit is to take a long-term perspective.  It’s a long-term problem.  If Congress and the Administration are able to make credible commitments to cutting programs or in any way changing the fiscal profile going forward over a long period of time, that is the most constructive way to address what is, in fact, a long-run problem.  If the changes are focused entirely on the short run, then they might have some consequences for growth.  And in that case, the Federal Reserve, which is, as always, going to try to set monetary policy to meet our mandate, would take those into 20 of 26  account appropriately.  But so far, I’ve not seen any fiscal changes that have really changed our near-term outlook. \n",

In minutes from the March meeting, you—the Committee noted that the development in Japan increased uncertainties.  So what’s the latest assessment on those risks or uncertainties such as tragedy in Japan or crisis in Europe and uprising in the Middle East?  And what would be the impact of those on the U.S. economy and the world economy?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, one of the things that our projections include—you know, we’re only producing the forecast today—with our minutes in three weeks, we’ll include the full detailed projections as we normally do.  One of the things that we include is the views of the participants on the amount of uncertainty there is in the forecast going forward.  And I think I can say, without too much fear of giving away the secret, that FOMC participants do see quite a bit of uncertainty in the world going forward, and a lot of that uncertainty is coming from global factors.  I’ve already talked about Middle Eastern–North Africa developments which have affected oil prices, conditions in emerging markets which have affected commodity prices and other things.  The European situation continues, and we’re watching that very carefully.  Now, obviously, you asked about Japan.  Let me first say, you know, that I’ve had a lot of contact with my Japanese counterparts, central bank Governor Shirakawa and other people in the Japanese government.  We collaborated with them on the foreign exchange intervention, as you know.  And we are very admiring of the courage of the Japanese people in responding to these situations and of—the central bank of Japan has done, I think, a good job in providing liquidity and helping to stabilize financial markets in what are very, very significant disturbances to the economy.  The 21 of 26  implications for Japan have been discussed at some length, and I think Governor Shirakawa recently talked about them.  In the near term, there will probably be a decline in Japanese output, reflecting the destruction, reflecting electricity problems, et cetera.  We believe that will be relatively temporary and that the economy will start to come back.  But, of course, this is a major blow, and it will take a lot of effort on the part of the Japanese people to restore the economy and to recover from the damage that was done by the—by the tragedy.  For the United States, we are looking at this very carefully.  Thus far, the main impact of the Japanese situation on the U.S. economy has been through supply chains.  We’ve noted some automobile companies, for example, that have had difficulty getting certain components which are manufactured mostly or entirely in Japan.  And that has led a number of companies to announce that they would restrain production for a time.  So there may be some moderate effect on—on the U.S. economy.  But we expect it to be moderate and to be temporary.  Again, the most important issue here is—is the recovery of Japan, and our good wishes go out to the Japanese people and their efforts to overcome the adversity that they’re facing.   \n",

But those tools are operating through financial conditions, and we have a lot of experience understanding how financial conditions—changes in interest rates, changes in stock prices, and so on—how they affect the economy, including both growth and inflation.  So we are monitoring 22 of 26  the state of the economy, watching the evolving outlook.  And our intention, as is always the case, is to tighten policy at the appropriate time to ensure that inflation remains well controlled, that we meet that part of our mandate, while doing the best we can to ensure also that we have a stable economy and a sustainable recovery in the labor market.  So the problem is the same one that central banks always face, which is choosing the appropriate path of tightening at the appropriate stage of the recovery.  It’s difficult to get it exactly right, but we have a lot of experience in terms of what are the considerations and the economics that underlie those the recovery to continue and allow the economy to return to a more normal configuration, at the same time keeping inflation low and stable.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks, mom [laughing].  Well, the Federal Reserve has been looking for ways to increase its transparency now for many years, and we’ve made a lot of progress.  It used to be that the mystique of central banking was all about not letting anybody know what you were doing.  As recently as 1994, the Federal Reserve didn’t even tell the public when it changed the target for the federal funds rate.  Since then, we have taken a number of steps.  A statement, which includes a vote.  We have—we produce very detailed minutes which are released only three weeks after the meeting, which is essentially a production lag.  We now provide quarterly projections, including long-run objectives as well as near-term outlook.  We have substantial means of communicating through speeches, testimony, and the like.  And so we have become, I think, a very—a very transparent central bank.  That being said, we had a subcommittee headed by the Vice Chair of the Board, Janet Yellen, looking for yet additional steps to take to provide additional transparency and accountability.  And the press conference was—came right to the top, because this is an area, first of all, where global central bank practice includes now—many central banks do use press conferences, and we have some experience with them.  And, secondly, it does provide a chance for the Chairman, in this case, to provide some additional color and context for both—in this case both the meeting and the projections that are 24 of 26  being made by the Committee.  So we thought it was a natural next step.  We’re not done.  We’re continuing to look for additional things that we can do to be more transparent and more accountable.  But we think this is the right way to go.  And I personally have always been a big believer in providing as much information as you can to help the public understand what you’re doing, to help the markets understand what you’re doing, and to be accountable to the public for what you’re doing.  Now, of course, the Fed didn’t do this for a long time.  And I think the counterargument has always been that, if there was a risk, that the Chairman speaking might create unnecessary volatility in financial markets or may not be necessary, given all the other sources of—of information that come out of the Federal Reserve.  It was our judgment, after thinking about this for some time, that at this point, the additional benefits from more information, more transparency, meeting the press directly, outweigh some of these—some of these risks.  And I think, over time, you know, we’ll experiment to try to make sure that this is as effective a venue as possible. \n",

      "QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote a book looking at 800 years of financial history and discovered that, when you have a financial crisis, it takes a lot longer for the economy to recover.  Are people expecting too much from the Federal Reserve in terms of helping the economy recover?  And has that complicated your monetary policymaking?  \n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me just say, first, that Ken Rogoff was a graduate school classmate of mine, so I’ve known him for a long time.  I’ve even played chess against him, which was a big mistake.  And I enjoyed that book very much.  I thought it was very informative.  And as you say, it makes a point that, as an historical matter, that recoveries following financial crises tend to be relatively slow.  Now, what the book didn’t really do, though, was given a full explanation of why that’s the case.  Certainly, part of it has to do with 25 of 26  the problems in credit markets, and my own research when I was in academia focused a great deal on the effects of problems in credit markets on recoveries.  Other aspects would include the effects of credit problems on areas like housing and so on.  And we’re seeing all that, of course, in our economy.  But that said, another possible explanation for the slow recovery from financial crises might be that policy responses were not adequate, that they—that the recapitalization of the banking system, the restoration of credit flows, and monetary and fiscal policies were not sufficient to get—to get as quick a recovery as might otherwise have been possible.  And so, you know, we haven’t allowed that historical fact to dissuade us from doing all we can to support a strong recovery.  That being said, it is a relatively slow recovery, and you can identify reasons for that.  Credit factors are one.  Another very important factor is that, you know, this was triggered by a bubble in the housing market, and the housing market remains very weak.  And under normal circumstances, construction, both residential and nonresidential, would be a big part of the recovery process.  And so there are a number of factors, and now we’re seeing high oil prices and other things.  There are a number of factors which are holding—which are holding the recovery back.  So there are good reasons for why the recovery is slower than we would like.  At the same time, it’s very hard to blame the American public for being impatient.  Conditions are far from where they—where we would like them to be.  The combination of high unemployment, high gas prices, and high foreclosure rates is a terrible combination.  A lot of people are having a very tough time.  So I can certainly understand why people are impatient.  And I guess the only thing I can say is that, while the recovery process looks likely to continue to be a relatively moderate one compared to the depth of the—of the recession, I do think that the pace will pick up over time.  And I am very confident that, in the long run, that the U.S. will return to being the most productive—one of the fastest growing and dynamic economies in the 26 of 26  world.  And it hasn’t lost any of the basic characteristics that made it the preeminent economy in the world before the crisis, and I think we’ll return to that status as we recover.   Thank you very much, and thank you for coming.\n"
