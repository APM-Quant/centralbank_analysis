      "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12âmonth basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.\n",

The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1â1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.\n",

Participants generally agreed that purchasing such securities could be a useful adjunct to other monetary policy tools in some circumstances. One participant preferred to begin purchasing Treasury securities immediately, as a way to increase the monetary base, in lieu of expanding programs that aim to support particular segments of the credit markets. Other participants were prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. However, they judged that purchases of longer-term Treasury securities would only modestly improve conditions in private credit markets at present, and that completing already-announced plans to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and to support certain asset-backed securities markets was, in current circumstances, likely to be a more effective way to employ the Federal Reserve balance sheet to support credit flows to, and spending by, households and businesses.\n",

As of January 26, the System's total assets and liabilities stood at just under $2 trillion, about $300 billion less than on December 17, 2008. The drop, which resulted primarily from a decline in foreign central bank drawings on reciprocal currency arrangements and a reduction in issuers' sales of commercial paper to the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), seemed to reflect some improvement in the functioning of global interbank markets and the commercial paper market after the year-end.\n",

Several indicated that they expected the soon-to-be-implemented Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to improve liquidity and reduce disruptions in the markets for securities backed by student loans, credit card receivables, auto loans, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; they also noted that it might become necessary to enhance or expand the TALF or other programs. However, in the view of one participant, financial markets--including those for asset-backed securities--were working reasonably well, given the current high level of pessimism and uncertainty about economic prospects and asset values, and the System's lending and asset-purchase programs were resulting in undesirable distortions in the allocation of credit. Others noted that such programs could have undesirable consequences if expanded too far or continued too long. Many participants agreed that it would be desirable for the System to develop additional measures of the effects of its programs, and they encouraged additional research on analytical frameworks that could inform Federal Reserve policy actions with respect to the size and composition of its balance sheet.\n",

      "Several meeting participants noted that the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet along with continued growth of the money supply could help stabilize longer-run inflation expectations in the face of increasing economic slack and very low inflation in coming quarters. Over a longer horizon, however, the Federal Reserve will need to scale back its liquidity programs and the size of its balance sheet as the economy recovers, to avoid the risk of an unwanted increase in expected inflation and a buildup of inflation pressures. Participants observed that many of the Federal Reserve's liquidity programs are priced so that they will become unattractive to borrowers as conditions in financial markets improve; these programs will shrink automatically. In other cases, the Federal Reserve eventually may have to take a more active role in scaling back programs by adjusting their terms and conditions. More generally, the Federal Reserve may need to develop additional tools to manage the size of its balance sheet and the level of the federal funds rate as the economy recovers. As of late January, however, with financial conditions strained and the economic outlook weak, most participants agreed that the Committee should continue to focus on supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy through purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other measures--including the implementation of the TALF--that will keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level for some time.\n",

Most expressed support for extending the termination dates in order to reassure market participants that the facilities would remain in place as a backstop to private-sector credit arrangements while financial conditions remained strained; they were prepared to extend the facilities beyond year-end if conditions warrant. Participants also noted that extending the termination date of these liquidity facilities to October 30 would not rule out the possibility of closing particular facilities sooner if improvements in financial conditions were to indicate they were no longer needed to support credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price stability.\n",

Conditions in the labor market continued to deteriorate rapidly in December: Private payroll employment fell sharply, and the unemployment rate rose. Industrial production dropped more severely than in earlier months.

Output in high-tech sectors contracted in the fourth quarter, reflecting reduced production of semiconductors, communications equipment, and computers.

Outlays on motor vehicles edged down in November and December following a sharper decline in October. Early indicators of spending in January pointed to continued soft demand.

Multifamily starts also fell in those months, as did permit issuance for both categories. Housing demand remained very weak and, although the stock of unsold new single-family homes continued to move down in November, inventories of unsold homes remained elevated relative to the pace of sales. Sales of existing single-family homes dropped less than sales of new homes in November and turned up in December, but the relative strength in sales of existing homes appeared to be at least partly attributable to increases in foreclosure-related and other distressed sales. Although the interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined markedly over the intermeeting period, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices that was conducted in January indicated that banks had tightened lending standards on prime mortgage loans over the preceding three months.

Orders and shipments for many types of equipment declined in October and November, and imports of capital goods dropped back in those months. Forward-looking indicators of investment in equipment and software pointed to likely further declines. Construction spending related to petroleum refining and power generation and distribution continued to increase briskly in the second half of 2008, responding to the surge in energy prices in the first half of that year, but real investment for many types of buildings stagnated or declined. Vacancy rates for office, retail, and industrial properties continued to move up in the fourth quarter, and the results of the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that financing for new projects had become even more difficult to acquire.\n",

The moderation in core PCE prices was widespread across categories of goods and services.

      "The decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at its December 15-16 meeting reportedly were more aggressive than investors had been expecting. Market participants reportedly were somewhat surprised both by the size of the reduction in the target federal funds rate, to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, and by the statements that policy rates would likely remain low for some time and that the FOMC might engage in additional nontraditional policy actions such as the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked down their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate, as measured by money market futures rates. The path first moved down immediately after the December FOMC meeting. Later in the period, the policy path tilted lower in response to weaker-than-expected economic data releases and increased concerns about the health of some financial institutions. In contrast, yields on medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury coupon securities increased, on net, over the period. Yields dropped sharply following the release of the FOMC statement, reportedly in part because investors interpreted it as suggesting that the Federal Reserve might increase its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities. Those price movements were more than reversed after the turn of the year, despite the worsening economic outlook, apparently reflecting a waning of year-end safe-haven demands and an anticipation of substantially increased Treasury debt issuance to finance larger-than-expected deficits associated with the new Administration's economic stimulus plans. Although implied inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) increased over the period, this increase reportedly was largely attributable to improved trading conditions in the TIPS market rather than upward revisions to inflation expectations.\n",

Recent auctions of term funds under the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility were undersubscribed, although one auction following the year-end did see a relatively large number of bidders.

However, the pace of delivery fails continued to run well below the high rates of September and October, reflecting in part reductions in transaction volumes as well as industry efforts to mitigate fails, including the January 5 recommendation of the Treasury Market Practices Group to implement a financial charge on settlement fails.

Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial investment-grade companies remained solid, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds was limited.

Those firms substantially underperformed the broader market as a number of large and regional banks reported sizable losses stemming from weak trading results, asset write-downs, and additional increases in loan-loss provisions in anticipation of a further deterioration in credit quality. CDS spreads for U.S. bank holding companies rose sharply in mid-January to near their historical highs, and equity prices for such companies fell on net, ending the period below their November lows. A number of banking organizations issued debt through the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program; spreads on such debt declined to levels close to those on agency debt. The Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program provided additional support to several banking institutions. In particular, to support financial market stability, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve announced on January 16 that they had entered into an agreement with Bank of America to provide a package of guarantees, liquidity access, and capital. Developments at nonbank financial institutions were mixed. Equity prices of insurance companies edged down over the period, while their CDS spreads declined from extremely high levels.

      "Staff Economic OutlookIn the forecast prepared for the meeting, the staff revised down its outlook for economic activity in the first half of 2009, as the implications of weaker-than-anticipated economic data releases more than offset an upward revision to the staff's assumption of the amount of forthcoming fiscal stimulus. Conditions in the labor market deteriorated sharply over the intermeeting period. Industrial production declined steeply, and household and business spending fell more than anticipated. Sales and starts of new homes remained on a steep downtrend. Foreign demand also was weaker than expected. Financial markets continued to be strained overall, credit remained unusually tight for both households and businesses, and equity prices had fallen further. The staff's projections of real GDP growth in the second half of 2009 and in 2010 were revised upward slightly, reflecting greater monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as the effects of more moderate oil prices and long-term interest rates, but they continued to show no more than a gradual economic recovery. The staff again expected that unemployment would rise substantially through the beginning of 2010 before edging down over the remainder of that year. Forecasts for core and overall PCE inflation in 2009 and 2010 were little changed, with growth in both core and overall PCE prices expected to be unusually low over the next few years in response to slack in resource utilization and relatively flat prices anticipated for many commodities and for imports.\n",

To provide the public with information about their views of likely longer-term economic trends, and as additional context for the Committee's monetary policy discussions, participants agreed to collect and publish, on a quarterly basis, projections of the longer-run values to which they expect these three variables to converge.

      "In their discussion of the economic and financial situation and the outlook for the economy, participants agreed that the economy had weakened further going into 2009. The incoming data, as well as information received from contacts in the business and banking communities, indicated a sharp and widespread economic contraction both domestically and abroad, reflecting in large part the adverse effects of the intensification of the financial crisis and the interaction between deteriorating economic and financial conditions. Participants generally saw credit conditions as extremely tight, with financial markets fragile and some parts of the banking sector under substantial stress. However, modest signs of improvement were evident in some financial markets--particularly those that were receiving support from Federal Reserve liquidity facilities and other government actions. Participants anticipated that a gradual recovery in U.S. economic activity would begin during the third or fourth quarter of this year as the economy begins to respond to fiscal stimulus, relatively low energy prices, and continuing efforts to stabilize the financial sector and increase the availability of credit. Several participants noted that firms' efforts to control inventories as sales declined had contributed to the rapid downturn in production and employment in recent quarters, but expected that the resulting absence of widespread inventory overhangs might spur a prompt pickup in production in many sectors later this year once sales begin to level out or turn up. Headline inflation would pick up some as the effects of previous declines in oil and other commodity prices wore off. But in an environment of considerable economic slack, little if any inflation pressure from energy or other import prices, and possible declines in inflation expectations, headline and core inflation were expected to be quite low for several years. Participants were, however, quite uncertain about the outlook. All but a few saw the risks to growth as tilted to the downside; in light of financial stresses and tight credit conditions, they saw a significant risk that the economic recovery would be both delayed and initially quite weak. In particular, most participants saw the renewed deterioration in the banking sector's financial condition as posing a significant downside risk to the economic outlook absent additional initiatives to stabilize the banking system.\n",

Some participants mentioned that business contacts had indicated that firms were reducing payrolls aggressively and also freezing wages and salaries, further restricting growth in personal income and thus probably damping consumer spending. Looking ahead, participants anticipated that tax cuts and some other elements of the proposed fiscal stimulus package would add to after-tax incomes and thus boost consumer spending, though the magnitude of the impetus was far from clear. For example, unless the cuts were clearly perceived to be permanent, the boost to consumer spending might prove short-lived, as was the case with the tax rebates distributed in the spring of 2008.\n",

Some participants worried that the outcome could be an increase in defaults on commercial real estate mortgages and forced sales of commercial properties, which could push prices down further and generate additional losses on banks' commercial real estate loan portfolios. However, the commercial real estate sector had expanded more moderately during the recent expansion than during the expansion of the late 1980s, suggesting that the downturn in the current cycle could be milder than that seen in the early 1990s.\n",

Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack. Many participants noted some risk of a protracted period of excessively low inflation, especially if inflation expectations were to move down in response to lower actual inflation and increasing economic slack, and a few even saw some risk of deflation. Several others, however, anticipated that longer-run inflation expectations would remain well anchored, supported in part by the Federal Reserve's aggressive expansion of its balance sheet and the resulting growth of the monetary base, and therefore thought it unlikely that inflation would decline below levels they saw as consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment.

In addition, a few participants noted that the sizes of some Federal Reserve liquidity programs are determined by banks' and market participants' need to use those programs and thus will tend to increase when financial conditions worsen and shrink when financial conditions improve; the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet needs to be able to adjust in response.\n",

However, while he recognized that spreads were elevated and volumes low in many credit markets, he saw no evidence of market failures that made targeted credit programs, including the forthcoming TALF, necessary. Moreover, he was concerned that such programs channel credit away from other worthy borrowers, amount to fiscal policy, would exacerbate moral hazard, and might be hard to unwind. He supported, instead, maintaining the size of the balance sheet at a high level through purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.

      "Conference CallOn January 16, 2009, the Committee met by conference call to discuss issues associated with establishing an explicit numerical objective for inflation. The Committee made no decisions on whether to establish such an objective. Most meeting participants expressed the view that an explicit numerical objective for longer-run inflation would be fully consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability and would not impede fostering the stability of the financial system. A number of participants emphasized that additional clarity on the longer-run inflation goal would further enhance Federal Reserve communications but would not involve any substantive change in monetary policy strategy. Many participants agreed that establishing and maintaining a transparent numerical inflation objective would be helpful--at least to some degree--in anchoring inflation expectations and thereby improve the overall effectiveness of monetary policy; others judged that the potential benefits of an explicit numerical inflation objective might be largely attained by extending the horizon of their regular projections for economic activity and inflation. Some indicated that the establishment of a numerical inflation objective could be particularly helpful under present circumstances in forestalling an unwelcome decline in longer-run inflation expectations---and hence in contributing to economic recovery--while also assuring the public that actions taken to counter economic weakness will not lead to high inflation over the longer-run. However, several participants expressed concern that an initiative to clarify the Committee's longer-run inflation objective could be confusing to the public in the current context of economic weakness and financial market strains. Participants also discussed several technical issues related to the implementation and communication of an explicit numerical inflation objective. They expressed a range of views about whether such an objective should be expressed in terms of the consumer price index or the PCE price deflator, the merits of a point value versus a range, the length of time over which policy would aim to achieve any such objective, and the frequency with which the Committee would reevaluate this framework. At this meeting, the staff also briefed the Committee on the coordinated set of measures for supporting Bank of America that had been taken by the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve earlier that day.\n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open our policy strategy.  I will then be glad to take your questions.   As indicated in its statement, the Committee decided today to maintain the policies that were initiated at previous meetings.  In particular, the Committee is keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue the program that we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treasury securities.  Our purchases of longer-term securities exert downward pressures on longer-term interest rates; at the same time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of our sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest rates.  Consequently, this maturity extension program should foster more accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping support a stronger recovery without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our previously announced program in which the principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities are being reinvested in agency MBS.  The Committee regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings, and we are prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.   2 of 22  In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer run.  The central tendencies and ranges of those projections are depicted in the figures that have been distributed.  The longer-run projections—shown at the right side of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over time, assuming appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy.   The longer-run projections for growth of real GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to 2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  These projections can be interpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run.  Because the economy's longer- run normal rates of output growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and that cannot often be directly measured, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision.   The central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  The inflation outlook over the longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections essentially reflect participants’ judgments about the inflation rate that is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices.  In effect, the “mandate-consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  Participants’ projections for real GDP for 2011 as a whole have a central tendency of 1.6 to 1.7 percent.  Output growth strengthened during the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on 3 of 22  growth earlier in the year.  In particular, global supply chain disruptions associated with the natural disaster in Japan have diminished.  Moreover, the prices of oil and other commodities have come down from their peaks, easing strains on household budgets and contributing to a somewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months.   The Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses, volatility in financial markets, fiscal consolidation at all levels of government, and other factors.  Looking further ahead, economic growth is expected to pick up somewhat as a result of improving financial conditions, strengthening consumer and business confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ growth projections picks up gradually from 2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014.   In light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quarters.  Participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of 8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ percentage point lower than the latest monthly reading of 9.1 percent.  The unemployment rate is expected to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.   In short, while we still expect that economic activity and labor market conditions will improve gradually over time, the pace of progress is likely to be frustratingly slow.  Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  Most notably, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which 4 of 22  have likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth.  European leaders have recently announced a number of steps to address those issues.  We will continue to monitor European developments closely.   I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.  The prices of oil and other commodities rose sharply earlier this year.  Consumer inflation consequently picked up over the first half of 2011, reflecting higher prices of gasoline, food, and other goods and services for which producers passed higher input costs along to their customers.  In addition, prices of motor vehicles surged in response to the global supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan.  However, inflation appears to have moderated as those transitory influences have waned, and as low levels of resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages.  Furthermore, survey measures and Consequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle at or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent or a bit less.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014.  The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.   The current economic outlook provides important context for understanding today’s policy decision.  The Committee’s mandate from the Congress is to seek maximum employment and price stability.  With unemployment well above normal levels and expected to decline only slowly, and with inflation expected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the Committee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.  We will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming 5 of 22  information, and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.   Finally, I would like to note that the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy public communications.  Specifically, we have been engaging in a series of discussions about potential approaches to providing the public additional information about our monetary policy goals and policy strategy, as well as about our outlook for the economy and for the future stance of monetary policy.  However, no decisions about such approaches were made at this meeting.   Thank you for your patience, and I would be happy to take your questions.   \n",

      "STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, over the past several months, it seems there’s been increasing criticism of the Fed’s policy.  You received a letter on the eve of the September meeting urging you not to take action from the GOP leadership.  Several GOP presidential candidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates.  On the first issue, do you feel that crossed the line?  Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed’s independence?  On the second question, what are the GOP presidential candidates not hearing or understanding about Fed policy, in your opinion?  \n",

I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longer term, in the short term, it’s very important that the Fed be free from political pressures.  And therefore, we are going to make our decisions based on what’s good for the economy, and we’re not going to take any politics into account.   6 of 22  Now, the concerns that have been expressed relate to the possibility that the Fed’s highly expansionary policies might be contributing to inflation risk.  I would simply point to the record.  If you look back for the last five years, inflation—although it’s been volatile because of commodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area where we have fallen short, obviously, is on the unemployment side.  So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to be very valid.   \n",

We talked today—or yesterday, actually—about nominal GDP as an indicator, as an information variable, as something to add to the list of variables that we think about, and it was a very interesting discussion.  However, we think that within the existing framework that we have, which looks at both sides of the mandate, not just some combination of the two, we can communicate whatever we need to communicate about future monetary policy.  So we are not contemplating at this 7 of 22  date—at this time—any radical change in framework.  We are going to stay within the dual-mandate approach that we’ve been using until this point.   \n",

      "JENNIFER LIBERTO.  Chairman, you’ve said in the past you understand some of the anger on display with the Occupy Wall Street protesters.  And a lot of the anger is directed at the Fed, with some protesters saying that the Fed is part of the problem, that the Fed preserves the financial system and promotes income inequality.  Can—are the protesters right?  Is the Fed part of the problem?  And, secondarily, can the Fed do anything to promote a more equitable economy?    \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I’ve said before, I certainly understand that many people are dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  I’m dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  Unemployment is far too high.  Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been going on—increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that has continued, we now have a more unequal society than we’ve had in the past.  So again, I fully sympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be, and in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectrum are understandable.   I think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions.  The Federal Reserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the financial system in 2008 and 2009.  A very simplistic interpretation of that was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve, you know, bankers’ salaries.  That is obviously not the case.  What we were doing is trying to protect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collapse of both the financial system and the American economy.  We needed to take those steps.  If we hadn’t taken them, the consequences would have been dire.  And not everybody understands that, and therefore they sometimes misunderstand our motives.  Our motives are strictly to do what’s in the interest of 8 of 22  the broad public, and I believe that our efforts to stabilize the financial system, which ultimately proved successful, were very much in the interest of the broad public.   With respect to the current economy, as I described earlier, we are currently continuing with our accommodative monetary policy.  We are trying to do our best to support economic growth and job creation.  I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from some other parts of the government to work with us, to help create more jobs.  But certainly, we are doing our part to try to create more jobs and more opportunities in America.   With respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs.  It gives people opportunities.  It gives people a chance to earn income, gain experience, and to ultimately earn more.  But that’s an indirect approach; that’s really the only way the Fed can address inequality per se.   \n",

The statement says that short-term rates will stay near their current levels at least through mid-2013.  Does that suggest that the Fed could conceive of raising short-term interest rates before unemployment even gets to 8 percent or much lower?

But we haven’t come to that point yet, but we certainly would like to provide more clarity about that.

The Fed had stated the intention to move the structure of its balance sheet more to its original, you know, Treasuries-only composition.  But recently, it revived the MBS program through the reinvestments, and folks like Governor Tarullo and William Dudley have raised the possibility of further large-scale asset purchases on the MBS side.

That may be some time down the road at this point.  You’re also correct that as part of our policy action at the last meeting, we began to reinvest mortgage-backed securities and agency debt back into  mortgage-backed securities, thereby providing some additional support for the mortgage market.  The housing sector is a very important sector.  It’s—the problems in that sector are clearly a big reason why our economy is not recovering more quickly.

We’ve seen a little bit of improvement there, but it’s still obviously too low to be consistent with a full employment economy.   \n",

At that time, the company met the criteria that had been set forth in terms of management, financial condition, capacity, and so on to qualify to be a primary dealer.  We have set those standards in a way that would allow smaller firms like MF Global to participate in the primary dealer market.  But I would like to emphasize, I guess, a couple of points.  First, we are not the regulators of MF Global.  That’s done by the SEC and the CFTC, so we do not have ongoing insight into developments within the company.  And secondly, again, making them a primary dealer did not 11 of 22  in any way constitute a seal of approval.  In fact, the New York Fed’s website contains a statement pretty much to that effect.  So, they were a primary dealer, we stopped trading with them before they failed, and we’ve suffered no losses or other consequences from our transactions with the company.  Again, in terms of your question about leverage and financial condition, the company declined very, very quickly based on, apparently, a small number of large bets.  As far as I know we were not aware of that, but again, to emphasize, we were not—we are not the overseers, the regulators of that company.   \n",

The staff, in particular, presents us with information on forecast errors and on revisions, et cetera, and so we look at that very carefully.  I think it’s clear that—in retrospect, that the severity of the financial crisis and a number of other problems, including the dysfunction of the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than we initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by the household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery.  So, yes, we have again downgraded the medium-term forecast.  Evidently, the forces—you know, the drags on the recovery were stronger than we thought.   I would add, however, though, that although I think it’s very important to look at the fundamental factors affecting the recovery, there’ve been some elements of bad luck.  For example, this year, the combination of the natural disaster in Japan which had global impacts in terms of growth, oil price increases, the European debt crisis, which was not anticipated to be as severe and create as much volatility as it has in financial markets—all those things have been negatives for growth, and they do explain at least part of the downward revision.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, it’s a fair question.  I would first say that monetary policy is having effects on the economy.  And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.  One area where monetary policy has been blunted—the effects have been blunted—has been the mortgage market, where very tight credit standards have prevented many people from purchasing or refinancing their homes, and therefore the low mortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been as effective as we had hoped.  So, monetary policy may be somewhat less powerful in the current context than it has been in the past, but nevertheless, it is affecting economic growth and job creation.   If you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one, which is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the problems of high inflation but also very importantly has avoided the risk of deflation.  And we’ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem and very difficult to get out of once you are there.  So we have been able to achieve, on average, stable prices.   With respect to growth, I think that our policies, including the cutting of rates to zero in were very important for helping to explain why the economy stopped contracting and began to grow again in the middle of 2009.  I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth and job creation.  I would argue that we’ve also been successful with some of the later actions that we’ve taken, although it’s early to say for things like the maturity extension program, but we 14 of 22  always face the problem of asking the question, Well, where would we be without these policies?  And our best estimates are that—absent the support of monetary policy, that the economy would be in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher than it is.  That being said, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to where we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable.  Yes, I do think that with—you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price stability and maximum employment.  We’ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have are efficacious and that they don’t have costs or risks or negative side effects that are worse than the benefits.  We’ll always be making that evaluation.   \n",

Again, we did overestimate the pace of recovery for some fundamental reasons having to do with, as I mentioned, the time taken to achieve financial repair, the state of the housing market, and so on.  But that being said, as I indicated earlier, there has been a certain amount of bad luck, and I think the volatility in financial markets associated with the European situation has been—along with volatility associated with the U.S. fiscal conditions, has been a drag on recovery.  I think it’s part of the reason why the second half of 2011 was less strong than we anticipated when I was here at the last press conference in June.  So there has been that concern.  It’s showing up in Americans’ 18 of 22  confidence and sentiment.  You can see that right now consumer confidence is about where it was in the depths of recession; that’s very discouraging.  To some extent, at least, it will be a drag on consumer’s willingness to spend and to invest.   My best advice to Americans is to continue to live your lives, though, and to continue to think about your personal situation and try to make smart decisions based on your own financial position.  Clearly, Americans are trying to improve their balance sheets; they’re trying to pay down debt.  That’s, of course, important.  At the same time, you want to make smart decisions, you want to make good investments, you want to budget properly.  So financial literacy is a big part of this, and lack of financial literacy was one of the things that got us into this mess in the first place.  So I would advise people to try to be smart about their finances.  Unfortunately, we can’t disassociate ourselves from Europe; the things that are happening there do affect us, and that’s an unfortunate fact.

That, in turn, should lead to still lower mortgage rates and other interest rates which are relevant to the economy.

If that’s the case, then a monetary policy—by lowering interest rates, making financial conditions more accommodative—should stimulate demand, should stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical unemployment.  That is something that we know from a lot of experience, and, although it’s been a very slow process here, there’s no reason to think that the same basic effect will not work in this case as well.   Now, it’s also possible that part of the increase in unemployment reflects so-called structural factors—mismatches between worker skills and job opportunities, loss of skills, geographical mismatch, et cetera.  And to the extent that that’s the case, then monetary policy is much less effective because in that case, only other kinds of labor market policies really can make progress against that type of unemployment.  But again, I do think that a considerable part of the unemployment that we are seeing is cyclical and is thus amenable to monetary policy. 22 of 22  Final comment:  Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can become structural unemployment as people lose skills, as they lose attachment to the labor force, as their work networks dry up and so on.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I’d like to briefly first review today’s policy decision.  I’ll then turn next to the Federal Open Market Committee’s quarterly economic projections also being released today, and I’ll place today’s policy decision in the context of the Committee’s projections and the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  I’ll then be glad to take your questions.  Throughout today’s briefing, my goal will be to reflect the consensus of the Committee, while taking note of the diversity of views as appropriate.  Of course, my remarks and interpretations are my own responsibility.   In its policy statement released earlier today, the Committee announced, first, that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings, and, second, that it will complete its planned purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.  Of course, going forward, the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to meet the Federal Reserve’s mandate.   The Committee made no change today in the target range of the federal funds rate, which remains at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.   2 of 26  In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.  These projections are conditional on each participant’s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives.  A table showing the projections has been distributed.  I’m going to focus today on the central tendency projections, which exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.   I call your attention, first, to the Committee’s longer-run projections, which represent participants’ assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy.  As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey.  The longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in normal, or trend, rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run, respectively.  The economy’s longer-term rate of growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of technological change, and it should be noted that estimates of these rates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision over time.   The central tendency of the longer-run projection for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  In contrast to economic growth and unemployment, the longer-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by monetary policy; consequently, and given that these projections are based on the assumption that 3 of 26  monetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that Committee participants judge to be most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices.  At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the “mandate-consistent” rate of inflation is greater than zero for a number of reasons.  Perhaps most important, attempting to maintain inflation at zero would increase the risk of experiencing an extended bout of deflation, or falling wages and prices, which in turn could lead employment to fall below its maximum sustainable level for a protracted period.  Hence, a goal of literally zero inflation is not consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, most central banks around the world aim to set inflation above zero, usually at about 2 percent.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  As indicated in today’s policy statement, the Committee sees the economic recovery as proceeding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and investment in equipment and software continue to expand, supporting the recovery, but nonresidential investment is still weak and the housing sector is depressed.  In the labor market, overall conditions continue to improve gradually.  For example, the unemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employment increased in March; new claims for unemployment insurance and indicators of hiring plans are also consistent with continued improvement.   Looking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projected for 2012 and 2013.  Specifically, as the table shows, participants’ projections for output growth have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent for this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013.  These projections are a little below those made by the Committee in January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in particular reflects the somewhat slower-than-anticipated pace of growth in the first quarter.   4 of 26  The outlook for above-trend growth is associated with a projected reduction in the unemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to 8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to 5.6 percent.  The projected decline in the unemployment rate is relatively slow largely because economic growth is projected to be only modestly above the trend growth rate of the economy.   On the inflation front, commodity prices have risen significantly recently, reflecting geopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors.  Increases in commodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation.  However, measures of underlying inflation, though having increased modestly in recent months, remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  Consequently, the Committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity prices to be transitory; as the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflation should decline toward its underlying level.  Specifically, participants’ projections for inflation have a central tendency of 2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year, noticeably higher than in the January projections, before declining to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013—both about the same as in January.   The Committee’s economic projections provide important context for understanding today’s policy action as well as the Committee’s general policy strategy.  Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the likely future course of the economy.  Thus the Committee’s projections of the economy, not just current conditions alone, must guide its policy decisions.  The lags with which monetary policy affects the economy also imply that the Committee must focus on meeting its mandated objectives over the medium term, which can be as short as a year or two but may be longer, 5 of 26  depending on how far the economy is initially from conditions of maximum employment and price stability.   To foster maximum employment, the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient economic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level.  At 8.8 percent, the current unemployment rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward more normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow.  The substantial ongoing slack in the labor market and the relatively slow pace of improvement remain important reasons that the Committee continues to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy.   In the medium term, the Committee also seeks to achieve a mandate-consistent inflation rate, which participants’ longer-term projections for inflation suggest is 2 percent or a bit less.  Although the recent surge in commodity prices has led inflation to pick up somewhat in the near term, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the medium term, as I have discussed.  Consequently, the short-term increase in inflation has not prompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture.  Importantly, however, the Committee’s outlook for inflation is predicated on longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expect inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased commodity prices are unlikely to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages.  Thus, besides monitoring inflation itself, the Committee will pay close attention to inflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects.   In providing extraordinary monetary policy accommodation in the aftermath of the crisis, the Committee has not only reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a very low level, but has also expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet substantially.  The Committee at this 6 of 26  meeting continued its ongoing discussion of the available tools for removing policy accommodation, at such time as that should become appropriate.  The Committee remains confident that it has the tools that it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that economic conditions warrant such a step.  And in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that normalization, we will carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.   Thank you again, and I’d be glad to take your questions.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You’re correct.  We haven’t seen the GDP number yet.  But we, like most private-sector forecasters, are expecting a relatively weak number for the first quarter, maybe something a little under 2 percent.  Most of the factors that account for the slower growth in the first quarter appear to us to be transitory.  They include things like, for example, lower defense spending than was anticipated, which will presumably be made up in a later quarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick up again; and other factors like weather and so on.  Now, there are some factors there that may have a longer-term implication.  For example, construction, both residential and nonresidential, was very weak in the first quarter, and that may have some implications going forward.  So I would say that, roughly, that most of the slowdown in the first quarter is viewed by the Committee as being transitory.  That being said, we’ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking 7 of 26  into account factors like—like weaker construction and possibly just a bit less momentum in the economy.   \n",

We’ll be looking very carefully, first, to see if that recovery is, indeed, sustainable, as we believe it is.  And we’ll also be looking very closely at the labor market.  We’ve seen improvement in the labor market in the first quarter relative to the latter part of last year, but we’d like to see continued improvement—more job creation going forward.  At the same time, we’re also looking very carefully at inflation, the other part of our mandate.  As I’ve noted, inflation—headline inflation—is at least temporarily higher, being driven by gasoline prices and some other commodity prices.  Our expectation is that—that inflation will come down towards a more normal level.  But we’ll be watching that carefully and also watching inflation expectations, which—you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we’re going to see inflation remain under good control.  So to answer your question, I don’t know exactly how long it will be before a tightening process begins.  It’s going to depend obviously on the outlook and on those criteria which I suggested.  The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points:  “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.  Once those conditions are violated, or are we moving away from those conditions, that will be the time that we need to begin to tighten.  “Extended period” suggests that there would be a couple of meetings probably before—before 8 of 26  action.  But, unfortunately, the reason we use this vaguer terminology is that we don’t know with certainty how quickly response will be required, and, therefore, we will do our best to communicate changes in our view as—but that will depend entirely on how the economy evolves.   \n",

Let me just add to what he said, first, by saying that the Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is both in American interest and in the interest of the global economy.  There are many factors that cause the dollar to move up and down over short periods of time.  But over the medium term, where our policy is aimed, we’re doing two things.  First, we are trying to maintain low and stable inflation by our definition of price stability by maintaining the purchasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation low.  That’s obviously good for the dollar.  The second thing we’re trying to accomplish is to get a stronger recovery and to achieve maximum employment.  And, again, a strong economy, growing, with attracting foreign capital, is going to be good for the dollar.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the dollar—the dollar fluctuates.  One factor, for example, that has caused fluctuations that have been quite extreme during the crisis has been the safe-haven effect.  So, for example, during the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008, money flowed in to the Treasury market and drove up the value of the dollar quite substantially, reflecting the fact that U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world.  And a lot of what you’ve seen over the last couple of years is just the unwinding of that as the economy has strengthened and as uncertainty has—has been reduced.  But that’s indicative, I think, of the—of the high standing that the dollar still retains in the world.  Again, ultimately, the best thing we can do to create strong fundamentals for the dollar in the medium term is to, first, keep inflation low, which maintains the buying power of the dollar, and, second, to create a strong economy.   \n",

Can you talk about whether there’s anything that the Fed can or should do about that?  And can you also comment or elaborate on the increase that we’ve seen in the inflation forecasts that the Fed put out today?  \n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  Thanks, Jon.  So, first of all, gasoline prices obviously have risen quite significantly.  And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that higher gas prices are absolutely creating a great deal of financial hardship for a lot of people.  And gas, of course, is a necessity.  People need to drive to get to work.  So it’s obviously a very bad development to see gas prices rise so much.  Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make economic developments less favorable.  On the one hand, obviously, the higher gas prices add to inflation.  On the other hand, by draining purchasing power from households, higher gas prices 10 of 26  are also bad for the recovery.  They cause growth to decline as well.  So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.  Now, our—our interpretation of the increase in gas prices is the economist’s basic mantra of supply and demand.  On the one hand, we have a rapidly growing global economy.  Emerging market economies are growing very quickly, and their demand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong.  Indeed, essentially all of the increase in the demand for oil in the last couple of years and the last decade has come from emerging market economies.  In the United States, our demand for oil—our imports have actually been going down over time.  So the demand is coming from a growing economy where we’ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emerging market output in the last—since before the crisis.  And on the supply side, as everybody knows who watches television, we’ve seen disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa, in Libya, and in other places that have constrained supply. That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up quite significantly.  So, again, this is a very adverse development.  It accounts in the short run for the increase in our—pretty much almost all of the increase in our inflation forecast, at least in the very near term.  There’s not much the Federal Reserve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which is certainly not the right way to go.  After all, the Fed can’t create more oil.  We don’t control the growth rates of emerging market economies.  What we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a broader inflation, which would be much more difficult to extinguish.  Again, our view is that, most likely—of course, we don’t know for sure, but we’ll be watching carefully—our view is that gas prices will not continue to rise at the recent pace, and as they stabilize or even come down if the situation stabilizes in the Middle East, that that will provide some relief on the inflation front.  But we’ll have to watch it very carefully.   11 of 26  \n",

But for the most part, although there’s been some movement here and there, for the most part, I think it’s fair to say that medium-term inflation expectations have not really moved very much, and they still indicate confidence that the Fed will ensure that inflation in the medium term will be close to what I’ve called the mandate-consistent level.  What can we do?  In the short run, we can communicate and try to make sure the public understands what our policy is attempting to do, to be clear what our objectives are and what steps we’re willing to take to meet those objectives.  Ultimately, if—if inflation persists or if inflation expectations begin to move, then there’s no substitute for action.  We would have—we would have to respond.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  As I—as I’ve noted and as you’re all aware, we are—we are going to complete the program at the end of the second quarter, $600 billion.  We are going to do that pretty much without tapering.  We’re just going to let the purchases end.  Our view is that—based on past experience and based on our analysis—is that the end of the program is unlikely to have significant effects on financial markets or on the economy, the reason being that, first—just a simple point that we hoped we have telegraphed today—we hope we have communicated what we’re planning to do.  And the markets have well anticipated this step.  And you would expect that policy steps which are well anticipated by the market would have relatively small effects because whatever effects you’re going to have would have already been capitalized in the financial markets.  Secondly, we subscribe generally to what we call here the stock view of the effects of securities purchases, which—by which I mean that what matters primarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather the size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserve holds.  And so, when we complete the program, as you noted, we are going to continue to reinvest maturing securities, both Treasuries and MBS, and so the amount of securities that we hold will remain approximately constant.  Therefore, we shouldn’t expect any major effect of that.  Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy easing, should essentially remain constant going forward from—from June.  At some point, presumably early in our exit process, we will, I suspect, based on conversations we’ve been having around the FOMC table, it’s very likely that an early step would be to stop reinvesting all or part of the securities which are coming—which are maturing.  But take note that that step, although a relatively modest step, does constitute a policy tightening because it would be lowering the size of our balance sheet and, therefore, would be expected to essentially tighten financial conditions.  That being said, we therefore have to make that decision based on the 14 of 26  outlook, based on our view of how sustainable the recovery is and what the condition—the situation is respect to inflation.

Those include, obviously, all the steps we took to stabilize the financial system during the crisis—again, many of which were extraordinary measures taken under extreme circumstances.  Even beyond the steps we took to stabilize the system, we have created new ways to ease monetary policy.  We’ve brought the federal funds rate target close to zero.  We have used forward guidance in our language to affect expectations of policy changes.  And, of course, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term securities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing financial conditions and, therefore, providing support for recovery and for employment.  Going forward, we’ll have to continue to make judgments about whether additional steps are warranted.  But as we do so, we have to keep in mind that we do have a dual mandate, that we do have to worry about both the rate of growth but also the inflation rate.  And as I was indicating earlier, I think that—even purely from an employment perspective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise significantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant.  And so we do have to make sure 15 of 26  that we are paying adequate attention to both sides of our mandate.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Well, first, I do believe that the second round of securities purchases was effective.  We saw that first in the financial markets.  The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions.  And we saw increases in stock prices.  We saw reduced spreads in credit markets.  We saw reduced volatility.  We saw all the changes in financial markets and quite significant changes that one would expect if one was doing an ordinary easing of policy via a reduced federal funds rate.  And, indeed, we saw the same types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009.  So we were able to get the financial easing that we were trying to get.  We did get very significant easing from this program.  You would expect, based on decades of experience, that easing financial conditions would lead to better economic conditions, and I think the evidence is consistent with that as well.  As I discussed in more detail in my Humphrey–Hawkins testimony in the beginning of March, between late August when I first indicated that the Federal Reserve was seriously considering this additional step and early this year, not only the Federal Reserve but many outside forecasters upgraded their forecasts.  And we saw—we saw strengthening labor that the second round of securities purchases was ineffective could only be validated if one thought that this—this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return 16 of 26  us to full employment overnight.  We were very clear from the beginning that, while we thought this was an important step and that it was at an important time when we were all worried about a double dip and we were worried about deflation, we were very clear that this was not going to be a panacea, that it was only going to turn the economy in the right direction.  And, indeed, we published some analytics which gave job creation numbers which were significant but not—certainly not enough to completely solve the enormous jobs problem that we have.  So, again, relative to what we expected, anticipated, I think the program was successful.  Why not do more?  Again, this was similar to the question I received earlier.  The tradeoffs are getting—are getting less attractive at this point.  Inflation has gotten higher.  Inflation expectations are a bit higher.  It’s not clear that we can get substantial improvements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk.  And, in my view, if we’re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we’ve got to keep inflation under control.  So we’ve got to look at both of those—both parts of the mandate as we—as we choose policy.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first, you’re absolutely right.  Long-term unemployment in the current economy is—is the worst—really the worst it’s been in the postwar period.  Currently something like 45 percent of all the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or longer.  And we know the consequences of that can be very distressing because people who are out of work for a long time, their skills tend to atrophy—they lose contacts with the labor market, with other people working, the networks that they have built up.  And we saw in the European experience, for example, in the ’80s and ’90s, that a period of high unemployment with very long-term unemployment spells can actually lead unemployment to remain very high for a protracted period.  So it is a very significant concern.  And it’s one of the reasons that—that the Federal Reserve has been so aggressive.  By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.  So that’s part of the reason that we have been as aggressive as we have.  As the situation drags on and as the long-term unemployed lose skills and lose contact with the labor 18 of 26  of the scope of monetary policy.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, in one sense, S&P’s action didn’t really tell us anything because everybody who reads the newspaper knows that the United States has a very serious long-term fiscal problem.  That being said, I’m hopeful that this event will provide at least one more incentive for Congress and the Administration to—to address this problem.  I think it’s the most important economic problem, at least in the longer term, that the United States faces.  We currently have a fiscal deficit which is simply not sustainable over the longer term.  And if it’s not the addressed, it will have significant consequences for financial stability, for economic growth, and for our standard of living.  It is encouraging that we are seeing efforts on both sides of the aisle to think about this issue from a long-run perspective.  It’s not a problem 19 of 26  that can be solved by making changes only for the next six months.  It’s really a long-run issue.  We’re still a long way from a solution, obviously.  But it is, I think, of the highest importance that our political leaders address this very difficult problem as quickly and as effectively as they can.  And to the extent that the S&P action goads a response, I think that’s—that’s constructive.   \n",

      "QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, John Berry.  In the past, there have been times when fiscal policy has tightened, and the Federal Reserve has chosen to ease its policy in response partly to that, given whatever the circumstances in the economy were at the time.  Congress appears intent at this point in cutting spending significantly; it might restrain the economy as it appears to be doing in Britain where they’re following a similar path.  Is there anything the Fed can do or should do if, indeed, there are large budget cuts sometime in the next 18 months?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first let me say that, addressing the fiscal deficit, particularly the long-run unsustainable deficit, is a top priority.  And nothing I would want to say would be—should be construed as saying that I think it’s anything other than a top priority.  It’s very, very important that our leaders address this—address this issue.  I would also say that the cuts that have been made so far don’t seem to us to have very significant consequences for short-term economic activity.  Now, my preference in terms of addressing the—the long-term deficit is to take a long-term perspective.  It’s a long-term problem.  If Congress and the Administration are able to make credible commitments to cutting programs or in any way changing the fiscal profile going forward over a long period of time, that is the most constructive way to address what is, in fact, a long-run problem.  If the changes are focused entirely on the short run, then they might have some consequences for growth.  And in that case, the Federal Reserve, which is, as always, going to try to set monetary policy to meet our mandate, would take those into 20 of 26  account appropriately.  But so far, I’ve not seen any fiscal changes that have really changed our near-term outlook. \n",

      "QUESTION.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m Toshi Ogata with the Asahi Shimbun, Japanese newspaper.  I’d like to ask about uncertainties in the global economy or downside risks.  In minutes from the March meeting, you—the Committee noted that the development in Japan increased uncertainties.  So what’s the latest assessment on those risks or uncertainties such as tragedy in Japan or crisis in Europe and uprising in the Middle East?  And what would be the impact of those on the U.S. economy and the world economy?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, one of the things that our projections include—you know, we’re only producing the forecast today—with our minutes in three weeks, we’ll include the full detailed projections as we normally do.  One of the things that we include is the views of the participants on the amount of uncertainty there is in the forecast going forward.  And I think I can say, without too much fear of giving away the secret, that FOMC participants do see quite a bit of uncertainty in the world going forward, and a lot of that uncertainty is coming from global factors.  I’ve already talked about Middle Eastern–North Africa developments which have affected oil prices, conditions in emerging markets which have affected commodity prices and other things.  The European situation continues, and we’re watching that very carefully.  Now, obviously, you asked about Japan.  Let me first say, you know, that I’ve had a lot of contact with my Japanese counterparts, central bank Governor Shirakawa and other people in the Japanese government.  We collaborated with them on the foreign exchange intervention, as you know.  And we are very admiring of the courage of the Japanese people in responding to these situations and of—the central bank of Japan has done, I think, a good job in providing liquidity and helping to stabilize financial markets in what are very, very significant disturbances to the economy.  The 21 of 26  implications for Japan have been discussed at some length, and I think Governor Shirakawa recently talked about them.  In the near term, there will probably be a decline in Japanese output, reflecting the destruction, reflecting electricity problems, et cetera.  We believe that will be relatively temporary and that the economy will start to come back.  But, of course, this is a major blow, and it will take a lot of effort on the part of the Japanese people to restore the economy and to recover from the damage that was done by the—by the tragedy.  For the United States, we are looking at this very carefully.  Thus far, the main impact of the Japanese situation on the U.S. economy has been through supply chains.  We’ve noted some automobile companies, for example, that have had difficulty getting certain components which are manufactured mostly or entirely in Japan.  And that has led a number of companies to announce that they would restrain production for a time.  So there may be some moderate effect on—on the U.S. economy.  But we expect it to be moderate and to be temporary.  Again, the most important issue here is—is the recovery of Japan, and our good wishes go out to the Japanese people and their efforts to overcome the adversity that they’re facing.   \n",

      "QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, you have often stressed, as indeed you did again today, the importance of keeping inflation expectations low and stable to keep inflation itself under control.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we—we view our monetary policies as being not that different from ordinary monetary policy.  I mean, it’s true that we’ve used some different tools.  But those tools are operating through financial conditions, and we have a lot of experience understanding how financial conditions—changes in interest rates, changes in stock prices, and so on—how they affect the economy, including both growth and inflation.  So we are monitoring 22 of 26  the state of the economy, watching the evolving outlook.  And our intention, as is always the case, is to tighten policy at the appropriate time to ensure that inflation remains well controlled, that we meet that part of our mandate, while doing the best we can to ensure also that we have a stable economy and a sustainable recovery in the labor market.  So the problem is the same one that central banks always face, which is choosing the appropriate path of tightening at the appropriate stage of the recovery.  It’s difficult to get it exactly right, but we have a lot of experience in terms of what are the considerations and the economics that underlie those the recovery to continue and allow the economy to return to a more normal configuration, at the same time keeping inflation low and stable.   \n",

      "QUESTION.  Hughes Honore, Agence France-Presse.  Many of the commercial partners of the United States are very concerned about the evolution of your foreign exchange rate.  If in one hypothetical case the dollar would sink to a terrible level which would harm very much the U.S. economy and the prospect for the global economy because it affects the confidence of so many people, would you consider changing your monetary policy in accordance to that threat?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I said earlier, we do believe that a strong and stable dollar is in the interest of the United States and is in the interest of the global economy.  Our view is that the best thing we can do for the dollar is, first, to keep the purchasing power of the dollar strong by keeping inflation low and by creating a stronger economy through—through policies which support the recovery and, therefore, cause more capital inflows to the United States.  So those are the kinds of policies I think that in the medium term will create the conditions for an appropriate and healthy level of the dollar.  So I don’t think I really want to address a hypothetical which I really don’t anticipate, because I think that the policies that we are 23 of 26  undertaking, notwithstanding short-term fluctuations, will lead to a strong and stable dollar in the medium term.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks, mom [laughing].  Well, the Federal Reserve has been looking for ways to increase its transparency now for many years, and we’ve made a lot of progress.  It used to be that the mystique of central banking was all about not letting anybody know what you were doing.  As recently as 1994, the Federal Reserve didn’t even tell the public when it changed the target for the federal funds rate.  Since then, we have taken a number of steps.  A statement, which includes a vote.  We have—we produce very detailed minutes which are released only three weeks after the meeting, which is essentially a production lag.  We now provide quarterly projections, including long-run objectives as well as near-term outlook.  We have substantial means of communicating through speeches, testimony, and the like.  And so we have become, I think, a very—a very transparent central bank.  That being said, we had a subcommittee headed by the Vice Chair of the Board, Janet Yellen, looking for yet additional steps to take to provide additional transparency and accountability.  And the press conference was—came right to the top, because this is an area, first of all, where global central bank practice includes now—many central banks do use press conferences, and we have some experience with them.  And, secondly, it does provide a chance for the Chairman, in this case, to provide some additional color and context for both—in this case both the meeting and the projections that are 24 of 26  being made by the Committee.  So we thought it was a natural next step.  We’re not done.  We’re continuing to look for additional things that we can do to be more transparent and more accountable.  But we think this is the right way to go.  And I personally have always been a big believer in providing as much information as you can to help the public understand what you’re doing, to help the markets understand what you’re doing, and to be accountable to the public for what you’re doing.  Now, of course, the Fed didn’t do this for a long time.  And I think the counterargument has always been that, if there was a risk, that the Chairman speaking might create unnecessary volatility in financial markets or may not be necessary, given all the other sources of—of information that come out of the Federal Reserve.  It was our judgment, after thinking about this for some time, that at this point, the additional benefits from more information, more transparency, meeting the press directly, outweigh some of these—some of these risks.  And I think, over time, you know, we’ll experiment to try to make sure that this is as effective a venue as possible. \n",

      "QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote a book looking at 800 years of financial history and discovered that, when you have a financial crisis, it takes a lot longer for the economy to recover.  Are people expecting too much from the Federal Reserve in terms of helping the economy recover?  And has that complicated your monetary policymaking?  \n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me just say, first, that Ken Rogoff was a graduate school classmate of mine, so I’ve known him for a long time.  I’ve even played chess against him, which was a big mistake.  And I enjoyed that book very much.  I thought it was very informative.  And as you say, it makes a point that, as an historical matter, that recoveries following financial crises tend to be relatively slow.  Now, what the book didn’t really do, though, was given a full explanation of why that’s the case.  Certainly, part of it has to do with 25 of 26  the problems in credit markets, and my own research when I was in academia focused a great deal on the effects of problems in credit markets on recoveries.  Other aspects would include the effects of credit problems on areas like housing and so on.  And we’re seeing all that, of course, in our economy.  But that said, another possible explanation for the slow recovery from financial crises might be that policy responses were not adequate, that they—that the recapitalization of the banking system, the restoration of credit flows, and monetary and fiscal policies were not sufficient to get—to get as quick a recovery as might otherwise have been possible.  And so, you know, we haven’t allowed that historical fact to dissuade us from doing all we can to support a strong recovery.  That being said, it is a relatively slow recovery, and you can identify reasons for that.  Credit factors are one.  Another very important factor is that, you know, this was triggered by a bubble in the housing market, and the housing market remains very weak.  And under normal circumstances, construction, both residential and nonresidential, would be a big part of the recovery process.  And so there are a number of factors, and now we’re seeing high oil prices and other things.  There are a number of factors which are holding—which are holding the recovery back.  So there are good reasons for why the recovery is slower than we would like.  At the same time, it’s very hard to blame the American public for being impatient.  Conditions are far from where they—where we would like them to be.  The combination of high unemployment, high gas prices, and high foreclosure rates is a terrible combination.  A lot of people are having a very tough time.  So I can certainly understand why people are impatient.  And I guess the only thing I can say is that, while the recovery process looks likely to continue to be a relatively moderate one compared to the depth of the—of the recession, I do think that the pace will pick up over time.  And I am very confident that, in the long run, that the U.S. will return to being the most productive—one of the fastest growing and dynamic economies in the 26 of 26  world.  And it hasn’t lost any of the basic characteristics that made it the preeminent economy in the world before the crisis, and I think we’ll return to that status as we recover.   Thank you very much, and thank you for coming.\n"

       "123   Sure.  It’s a little bit early to fully assess the effects of what we call the maturity extension program.  But it does seem to be having, at least in a preliminary sense—it does seem to be havin...   \n",
       "125   Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation.  We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—that i...   \n",
       "127   We did see some improvement in the third quarter, a modest improvement.  We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventories, therefor...   \n",
       "128   Good afternoon.  Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved new measures to support the recovery and employment growth.  I’ll get to the specifics of our actions in a few mom...   \n",
       "130   Yes.  We’ll be looking for signs that the economy is strong enough to promote improvement and sustained improvement in labor market conditions and 6 of 25 we’re all the way back to full employmen...   \n",
       "132   Well, we’ve been talking about our communications at the FOMC and trying to think about how best to communicate to the public, you know, what our policy reaction function, so to speak, is.  And w...   \n",
       "134   Well, our policy approach doesn’t involve intentionally trying to raise inflation.  That’s not the objective.  The idea is to make sure we provide enough support so the economy will grow fast eno...   \n",
       "136   Well, if inflation goes above the target level, as we talked about in our statement in January, we take a balanced approach.  We bring inflation back to the target over time, but we do it in a wa...   \n",
       "138   Well, our assessment—I talked about this at my remarks at Jackson Hole—our assessment, and that of the research literature, is that the policies that we’ve undertaken have had real benefits for t...   \n",
       "140   Well, what happens is going to depend on where the economy goes—how much ultimate accommodation we give the economy.  The 0.4 percent you’re referring to is the change in the forecast between the...   \n",
       "142   Well, the ultimate effect is going to depend, of course, on how much we end up doing, and that, in turn, is going to depend on what the economy does.  9 of 25 This is a conditional program; we’re...   \n",
       "144   Well, there’s a variety of possibilities, and we continue to look at all different options.  But the two primary types of tools, as I’ve discussed, are balance sheet actions—and, of course, we ca...   \n",
       "146   Well we are—this is a Main Street policy, because what we’re about here is trying to get jobs going.  We are trying to create more employment, we are trying to meet our maximum employment mandate...   \n",
       "148   Well, again, we’re looking for ongoing sustained improvement in the labor market.  There’s not a specific number we have in mind.  But what we’ve seen in the last six months isn’t it.  We’re look...   \n",
       "150   Well, we—the problem is that, for this purpose, that what we’re looking for is a general improvement in labor market conditions.  We want to see the unemployment rate come down, but that’s not th...   \n",

       "156   Well, on the former, I’m—I have a lot to do.  I am very focused on my work, and I don’t have any decision or any information to give you on my personal plans.  On the politics, we have tried very...   \n",
       "158   Certainly.  We are very interested in and very focused on community banks at the Fed.  We believe they play a very important role in our economy and in our communities.  We have a number of ways ...   \n",

       "164   Well there’s, again, a range of areas where actions could be taken, and I can’t really prescribe all those possible responses.  I would focus, I think, on the fiscal side.  We currently have the ...   \n",
       "166   Well, the—on inflation, we do anticipate at some point what’s normal in a recovery, which is, given that the economy fell very quickly and there’s a lot of unused capacity, there’s a lot of slack...   \n",
       "168   Well, that’s an important question.  Michael Woodford— who, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well, and I know his works quite well—I think, actually...   \n",

       "177   Well, you are absolutely right.  And as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation.  Some decline in participati...   \n",
       "178   Good afternoon and welcome.   In my opening remarks I will briefly review today’s policy decision by the Federal Open to you regarding the Committee’s longer-run policy goals and strategy.  And f...   \n",
       "180   Steve, there’s certainly been some encouraging news recently.  We’ve seen slightly better performance in the labor market, consumer sentiment has    8 of 29 improved, industrial production has be...   \n",
       "182   Well, let me first observe that we have in fact, of course, been very accommodative in the last couple of years.  We’ve kept interest rates close to zero, we’ve done two rounds of asset purchases...   \n",
       "184   Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years.  Certainly, we are seeing a reversal, or at least a flattening out, of the commodity...   \n",
       "186   Well, your first question—our ability to forecast three and four years out is obviously very limited, there’s no question about that.  Nevertheless, we have to make a best guess, a provisional pl...   \n",
       "188   Well, the period of time, yes, we treat them symmetrically.  We cannot control, of course, where inflation and unemployment are at each moment in time, and so there will be periods when, for reas...   \n",
       "190   So I’m not going to get involved in political rhetoric.  I’m just going to stay completely away from that.  I have a job to do, and as long as I’m here, I will do everything I can to help the Fed...   \n",
       "192   Well, you’re referring, I think, to the 165–166 rules, which will focus on the supervisory oversight of the largest banks.  It’s a very big and complicated rule, as everyone knows, and so our pos...   \n",
       "193   So we will be providing, in our minutes and in our Survey of Economic Projections, which will be released in three weeks—we’ll be providing some additional qualitative information about peoples’—...   \n",
       "195   Well, again, first I want to emphasize that there is no mechanical relationship between these projections and the outcomes of the FOMC decisions.  Of course, they’re a big input into those decisi...   \n",
       "197   Well, the Federal Reserve obviously has a very strong interest in the housing sector.  The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why the economy is not recovering more robustly, a...   \n",
       "199   Well, whenever the Fed takes a policy action, there’s always some potential for a signal.  I mean, that’s true not just in these current times, but anytime the Fed lowers or increases interest ra...   \n",
       "201   Well, again, as I said earlier, the Fed has been doing a great deal.  Just since August we have put a date on our expected period of low interest rates.  We undertook the maturity extension progr...   \n",
       "203   Excellent questions.  So, a literal reading of price stability would say inflation should be at zero.  Now, there are some technical reasons why that may not be true.  There are probably some mea...   \n",
       "205   On the first question, I, you know—as was pointed out by Steve, for example—we’ve had some good data recently.  I think there’s some uncertainty about where the economy is going, and we want to c...   \n",
       "207   No, that’s a very good question.  I might have commented on Zach’s question that our two main tools at this point—given that short-term interest rates are close to zero—are asset purchases, but t...   \n",
       "209   Well, lending to financial institutions is part of our mandated function; it’s part of our raison d’être to provide a lender of last resort in the case of a panic, as we’ve done in the recent cri...   \n",
       "211   Sure.  Well, we chose the PCE index for some, I think, very valid technical reasons.  It better allows—better accounts for changes in people’s purchasing patterns; you know, when some things beco...   \n",
       "213   Well, as you know, the Federal Reserve makes it a policy to try to avoid commenting on specific individual tax and spending programs, and I don’t have those numbers at hand in any case.  But what...   \n",
       "214   Good afternoon.  Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then I’ll place the Committee’s policy decision in the context of our ec...   \n",
       "216   Well, first, the Committee has certainly been bold and aggressive in terms of easing monetary policy.  We’ve maintained the federal funds rate close to zero since late 2008.  We’ve had two rounds...   \n",
       "218   Well, I would just say, first, that our projections still have inflation very close to our 2 percent target.  As you point out, core inflation and some other measures of underlying inflation have...   \n",
       "222   Well, I’m very comfortable with the consensus view that we enunciated today, and I think that the Committee broadly is comfortable—a 9-to-1 vote in favor of this guidance.  So again, that represe...   \n",
       "224   The question is, you know, “How much more weakness do we need?”  The Committee has to make those assessments, and we’ve been working to try to provide more-explicit guidance, quantitative guidanc...   \n",
       "226   Well, there’s certainly a range of views, as you’ve noted, but these projections are inputs into a Committee process.  And it’s in the Committee meeting that we had yesterday and today where we d...   \n",
       "228   Well, again, the individual projections are inputs to the Committee decision, so the Committee decision is the critical element in that respect.  We are continuing to work to become more transpar...   \n",
       "230   Yeah.  Let me tackle that second part first.  So there’s this view circulating that the views I expressed about 15 years ago on the Bank of Japan are somehow inconsistent with our current policie...   \n",
       "232   Well, I think we’ll have to take fiscal policy into account to some extent, but I think it’s very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal authorities, the size of the fi...   \n",
       "234   Well, again, these are the views of the participants, the 17 participants.  So the basic feature that is described in our statement, which is that growth seems likely to pick up over time, is sti...   \n",
       "236   So it’s not a ceiling, it’s a symmetric objective, and we attempt to bring inflation close to 2 percent.  And in particular, if inflation were to jump for whatever reason—and we don’t have, obvio...   \n",
       "238   Well, it’s just supposed to be a factual description of what’s happening in the environment.  In January, the financial markets had calmed considerably, reflecting a number of steps taken in Euro...   \n",
       "240   Sure.  Well, if you compare this set of forecasts with reiterate that, once again, that these are just inputs into a decision process.  They represent individual estimates, and, quite admittedly,...   \n",
       "242   Yes.  I believe that too-big-to-fail was an important cause, or at least a propagating mechanism, of the financial crisis.  And I believe it’s absolutely incumbent upon us to do all we can to eli...   \n",
       "244   Well, I think that’s part of your job to say.  I think we’re making progress.  I think it was an important step to make clear what our inflation objective is—I thought that was important.  And we...   \n",
       "246   Well, the exact reading for the federal funds rate today, in the absence of the zero lower bound, would depend a lot on which particular rule, what particular model that you use.  I don’t want to...   \n",
       "248   “Exceptionally low”; you know, one of the reasons that language in the statement is sometimes a little vaguer than you would like is because we are trying to get a consensus among 17 or at least ...   \n",
       "250   Well, there may be circumstances where a bank or financial institution is artificially large.  And in that context, if it were posing a severe threat to financial stability, then I suppose that c...   \n",
       "252   Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability, it’s not to disappoint or  18 of 23  not disappoint investors.  So...   \n",
       "256   Well, I think the—I would draw two distinctions between the U.S. and Japan, or the Japanese experience.  The first is that, as I mentioned earlier—and I think this is very important—is that we ac...   \n",
       "258   On declaring victory, I think it’s a little premature to for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons; they include monetary policy, of course, but they also include a weak ec...   \n",
       "260   Oh, participation, labor participation, yes.  Actually, we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting because it is an important issue, trying to assess how much of the change in employmen...   \n",
       "262   Well, the weather issue just reflects how difficult it can be to make real-time assessments of the state of the economy.  The weather has probably affected a number of things.  It probably brough...   \n",
       "264   Well, we need something—estimates differ.  We need fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past—I suppose more like 100,000 a month for stability.  I don’t have a...   \n",
       "266   Well, those things are not all the same.  On the former, our subcommittee, headed by Vice Chair Yellen, is looking at the SEP for ways to improve transparency, and we’re looking at everything.  S...   \n",
       "267   Good afternoon.  Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then place the Committee’s appropriate path of monetary policy.   As ind...   \n",
       "269   Well, of course, you know, we cut the federal funds rate in a continuous fashion until December of 2008.  And since then, we’ve been operating with nonstandard monetary tools, including asset pur...   \n",
       "271   Well, we’ve taken a step today, which is a substantive step, which will provide additional accommodation for the economy.  And, moreover, we have stated that we’re prepared to take further steps ...   \n",
       "272   Well, there’s been a great deal of economic news since our last meeting.  The incoming data were somewhat disappointing—but not entirely clear how to read them.  We had issues with weather and se...   \n",
       "274   Well, as I’ve said many times, monetary policy is not a panacea.  Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems.  We welcome help and support from any other part of the go...   \n",
       "276   Well, I’ll just say first that we think that both of the asset purchase programs, so-called QE1 and QE2, did have significant effects on asset prices and financial conditions.  And although there...   \n",
       "278   Well, the interest rates are quite low, and they’re being pushed down more by safe-haven flows and other factors.  That being said, I think we can lower interest rates more.  But beyond that, Ope...   \n",
       "280   Well, it’s our intention to do all we can to make sure that it doesn’t go on indefinitely.  Unemployment is still too high, but it has come down.  It was about 10 percent at the peak, and now it’...   \n",
       "284   It depends on—each individual has their own path of optimal policy, so we’ll provide more information about that in the minutes.  But—and again, we’re prepared to do more.  We have to get, I thin...   \n",
       "286   Well, as you say, the Europeans are the first line.  Europe is a wealthy area.  They have adequate resources to address these problems.  They are very committed to addressing these problems becau...   \n",
       "288   Well, I think it’s still a bit early, but as we move forward in the year, we do anticipate that the uncertainty associated with the so-called fiscal cliff will have some economic effects.  We hea...   \n",
       "290   Well, that’s a difficult problem.  I’m not entirely sure.  On the one hand, a little clarity would probably be helpful for the reasons that I described, because people are uncertain about what’s ...   \n",
       "292   Sure.  Well, access to credit is a major issue, there’s no question about it.  Mortgage access is much tighter than it’s been for a long time.  Even credit card access is more restricted than it ...   \n",
       "294   Sure.  I gave a list of some of the headwinds in my opening remarks.  I do think that the European situation is slowing U.S. economic growth.  First of all, Europe is, if not in a recession in ev...   \n",
       "295   Well, the government is very gradually increasing the duration of its debt—the Treasury, I mean—and it’s been doing that for some period of time.  14 of 22  There’s a bit of an issue here, which ...   \n",
       "297   Well, I can’t give you any specific numbers because this is ultimately a Committee decision, but what the Committee is going to do is review all the labor improving in a sustainable way.  It’s no...   \n",

       "301   Well, on the second question, it’s a five-agency rule, I believe, and so a lot of coordination and cooperation is needed, and we had something like 18,000 comment letters, so it’s been a very dif...   \n",
       "302   Well, we hope it doesn’t get worse.  I think it’s already one of the factors that has been a drag on U.S. recovery—not the only factor by any means, there are a number of others that I mentioned,...   \n",
       "304   Well, we’re very interested in it, and we’re certainly going to follow it.  The details are not yet available.  And I think it should be noted that it’s not just a Bank of England program, but it...   \n",
       "306   Well, the—in terms of the inflation forecasts, again, I think it should be said, as a preliminary point, that economic projections have a lot of uncertainty 19 of 22  about them.  We talk about t...   \n",
       "308   Well, the U.S. economy is in a situation where short-term interest rates are close to zero.  And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term ...   \n",
       "310   Credit to consumers?  No, I don’t think so.  If—take, for example, I’ve heard the argument that by lowering interest rates, you make it unattractive to lend.  I don’t think that’s quite right.  W...   \n",

       "317   Good afternoon. It’s been about three and a half years since the economic recovery began.  The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high. ...   \n",
       "321   Well, so first, the—as I said—the asset purchases and the rate increases have different objectives.  The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to stren...   \n",
       "322   That’s a very good question.  We took the change today after a good bit of discussion.  We had a very substantial discussion of the threshold approach at our last meeting.  And we felt it was rea...   \n",
       "324   Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the economy.  Even though we’ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in, it’s already affecting business inve...   \n",

       "332   Well, it’s a good question.  So first of all, we don’t have a precise estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate.  The estimates that were provided in the Summary of Economic Projecti...   \n",
       "334   Sure.  I’m hoping that the Congress will do the right thing on the fiscal cliff.  I—you know, there’s a problem with kicking the can down the road.  It might avoid some of the short-term impact o...   \n",
       "335   No.  I think they’re equally important.  On the threshold numbers, this is based—these numbers are based on substantial analysis done by staff, both here and at the Reserve Banks, trying to asses...   \n",
       "337   If we got important new information about the structure of the economy, it’s possible, but I consider it relatively unlikely and this is one of the best—this is one of the advantages of this appr...   \n",
       "339   Well, I come from a part of South Carolina which has been economically challenged for quite a long time and remains so.  I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but ...   \n",
       "341   I wouldn’t say it was an important motivation for adding transparency.  I think transparency has a lot of value.  But it is the—it is a fact that this greater clarity will help markets better pre...   \n",

       "349   Well, on the second one, I’d like to think I’m bilingual.  When I go home sometimes I—it comes out pretty strongly, but I won’t try to do that here.  So, I   22 of 34  try to be careful, as you k...   \n",
       "351   Well, I think it’s fair to say that we have overestimated the pace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have had therefore—had to continue to scal...   \n",
       "353   Well, it’s entirely consistent with your view, with the point that you made.  So let me just reiterate it.  As we stated, in fact, in our January set of principles, the central bank cannot contro...   \n",
       "356   Well, we think it’s a better form of communication.  We think it’s—by using the thresholds which ties rates to economic conditions, we’re more transparent about what’s going to determine our poli...   \n",

       "374   Interesting question.  Well, I certainly hope that markets won’t have to tank.  I don’t—we want to have confidence, not just in markets but in businesses and households as well, and the best way ...   \n",
       "376   Well, first of all, just a couple of facts.  The—we’re buying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, about half and half, roughly.  So we’re buying considerably less than the Treasury is issu...   \n",
       "378   So the question is—just to restate your question—is about the spread between the mortgage rates that the public pays and the yields to mortgage-backed securities that banks may hold, and the ques...   \n",
       "379   Good afternoon.   The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  As always, my colleagues and I reviewed recent economic and financial developments and discussed th...   \n",
       "381   Well, to take your second question first, the lack of thresholds comes from the complexity of the problem.  On the one hand, we have benefits, which are associated with improvements in the econom...   \n",
       "383   Well, the problem with having just a single criterion is that it’s all or nothing.  We maintain full speed ahead until we hit a certain target, and then, you know, we stop.  That would be, I thin...   \n",
       "385   Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by “substantial improvement,” it’s a broad-based improvement in a range of indicators as well as improvement in output and labor demand.  So, as we...   \n",
       "387   Well, that’s going to be obviously a decision that the Committee has to make, and we will—at each meeting, we’ll look at progress that’s been made since the last meeting, try to assess the outloo...   \n",
       "389   That’s an issue for—obviously, there has been improvement, let me say that.  We’ve seen improvement in the last four or five months.  The last five months, for example, we’ve seen over 200,000 jo...   \n",
       "391   Well, first, on the reverberations, it’s a difficult situation in Cyprus.  You’ve got a situation where the banking system is a large multiple of the size of the  9 of 26 economy.  And so, in the...   \n",
       "393   Well, on the latter question, I don’t have anything for you.  I’ll certainly be informing the Wall Street Journal and other publications if I come to some In terms of term limits, I don’t have a ...   \n",
       "395   Pretty recently.  I have a relative that is unemployed.  But I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession.  Last time I was there, the unemployment rate ...   \n",
       "399   Well, again, I don’t—we’ve not been able to come to an agreement about what guidance we should give.  And part of the concern is—is that as we go forward, we—you know, we’ll have to factor in the...   \n",
       "401   Well, I think capital is an important element in addressing too-big-to-fail.  One of the things that will be proposed, and is not in effect yet, will be surcharges on the largest banks—that is, t...   \n",
       "403   Well, the tightening of credit in mortgage markets—I mean, our sense is that it’s gone too far.  I mean, some tightening was obviously needed.  There were people who bought houses prior to the cr...   \n",
       "405   That’s right.  We’re not targeting asset prices.  We’re not measuring success in terms of the stock market.  We’re measuring success in terms of our mandate, which is employment and price stabili...   \n",
       "406   Well, our analysis is fairly comparable to analysis that the Congressional Budget Office has presented to the Congress.  And they estimate that putting together all the fiscal measures, including...   \n",
       "408   Well, if in fact that happens, it’s an issue, obviously.  There’s been some disconnect, at least in the short run, between unemployment rate changes and  17 of 26 growth during this recovery, and...   \n",
       "412   Well, the reason for publishing the severely adverse scenario, of course, is that’s the ultimate acid test, you know, whether the banks are sufficiently  18 of 26 capitalized.  Presumably, if the...   \n",
       "414   Well, as you point out, we’re at the zero lower bound, and that makes further accommodation not impossible but more difficult and harder to predict, and  19 of 26 with more side effects that are ...   \n",
       "418   Yes, okay.  So, historically, the argument for having inflation greater than zero—we define price stability as 2 percent inflation, as do most central  20 of 26 banks around the world.  And one m...   \n",
       "420   I don’t think I know the answer to that question.  Certainly, the financial system has—I could argue two ways.  I could say, well, the U.S. economy grew pretty well between 1945 and 1975 or 1980....   \n",
       "422   Well, I have not been involved in those conversations and I don’t necessarily know all the details, and so I know they’re grappling with a very difficult problem.  I think the issue they face is ...   \n",
       "424   Well, you’re absolutely right that there’s been a certain tendency for a spring slump that we’ve seen a few times.  One possible explanation for that—besides some freaky things, some weather even...   \n",
       "426   Well, as someone mentioned, Cyprus is a tiny economy, and I don’t think that these issues, as worrisome as they are and as concerned as we would be for  23 of 26 the Cypriote people, I don’t thin...   \n",
       "428   On the first question, as I said, I mean that’s a decision for the Committee.  We’re going to have to make a judgment about how significant the improvement is, how sustained it is.  Long-term une...   \n",
       "430   Labor force participation, yes.  Labor force participation has been declining on a trend-like basis in the United States for a while.  That’s the result, mostly, of demographic factors, partly th...   \n",
       "432   Well, I still believe the following, which is that monetary policy is a very blunt instrument.  If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if you were sure you can do that, yo...   \n",
       "434   I’ve spoken to the President a bit, but I really don’t have any—I don’t really have any information for you at this juncture.  I don’t think that I’m the only person in the world who can manage t...   \n",
       "435   Good afternoon.   The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  Based on its review of recent economic and financial developments, the Committee sees the economy c...   \n",
       "437   That is—we had a good discussion of that issue today, and we haven’t had—obviously, there’s no change, there’s no change in policy involved here, there’s simply a clarification, helping people to...   \n",
       "441   Well, there are many factors that we look at when trying to judge the state of the labor market.  As you know, we look at participation, payrolls, a variety of other data, but the 7 percent unemp...   \n",
       "443   Well, the fundamentals look a little better to us.  In particular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis, is now, obviously, a support to growth.  It’s not only cre...   \n",
       "445   Well, that’s a good question.  Yes, rates have come up some.  That’s in part due to more optimism, I think, about the economy.  It’s in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve.  The foreca...   \n",
       "447   Well, we were a little puzzled by that.  It was bigger than can be explained I think by changes in the ultimate stock of asset purchases within reasonable ranges.  So I think we have to conclude ...   \n",
       "453   Well, it’s a great question and—but the—what you pointed out, the difference between the little dots and the forecast actually illustrates the point, which is, remember, the 6½ percent is a thres...   \n",
       "455   Well, “substantial” is in the eye of the beholder.  I think going from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic growth is a substantial increase.  I think...   \n",
       "457   Well, this is something we watch very carefully.  There are a number of, as I mentioned in the statement, there are a number of transitory factors that may be contributing to the very low inflati...   \n",
       "459   Well, it is important for us to communicate.  It’s particularly important when we have an unusual economic situation where I think the standard relationships are not applying in the way they have...   \n",
       "461   It’s certainly true that it’s taken time to do these regulations.  There are a number of reasons for that.  The first is that they are, inherently, many of them, quite complicated.  The Volcker r...   \n",
       "463   Well, as I’ve said, I’m not going to comment on my personal plans, but I will say this.  I think there’s a perception that the Jackson Hole conference is a Federal Reserve Systemwide conference. ...   \n",
       "465   Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down so fast that this becomes a problem.  I guess I would point out a couple of things.  One is that, of course, you know, there’s a range of e...   \n",
       "467   Well, we are still only a fraction of the total holdings of mortgage-backed securities, but, more relevant, as part of our assessment—of our ongoing assessment of the potential costs of our vario...   \n",
       "469   Well, these issues are being debated.  There are some—a number of bills in Congress which would change the GSEs, would eliminate them in some cases, or would place them with backstop government s...   \n",
       "471   Well, as I tried to explain in my opening remarks, our plans depend on the economic scenario and how it evolves.  And what I tried to do is explain how our asset purchases would evolve if, sort o...   \n",
       "475   I don’t disagree with anything you said.  I think low—inflation that’s too low is a problem.  It increases the risk of deflation.  It raises real interest rates.  It means that debt deleveraging ...   \n",
       "477   Well, when we—as I recall, I believe I have this right—when we introduced the second round of LSAPs, properly known as QE2, in, I think, November 2010, there was a lot of increase in commodity pr...   \n",
       "479   Well, I’m very glad to see that the SEC has taken up money the expertise and where they have the experience.  In terms of their actual proposal they’ve put out—of course, it’s just a proposal for...   \n",
       "481   Well, I think the volatility is mostly linked to the Bank of Japan’s efforts, and that would seem logical, since in earlier episodes, when the Fed was doing asset purchases and the BOJ was not do...   \n",
       "482   Well, again, we don’t think of this as a change in policy.  What I was deputized to do, if you will, was to try to make somewhat clearer the implications of our existing policy and to try to expl...   \n",
       "483   Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, the Committee decided today to keep the target range ...   \n",
       "485   Certainly.  So, I think there is a cyclical component to participation, and, in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true unemployment, if you will, in the econom...   \n",
       "487   So to answer the first part of your question, I think there’s no alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible, and that’s what we tried to do.  As of June, we h...   \n",
       "489   So there is no fixed calendar—schedule, I really have to emphasize that.  If the data confirm our basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook and we believe that the three-part test...   \n",
       "491   Well, it’s convenient because I have the same answer to all three parts of your question.  If you will indulge me just a little longer, I prefer not to talk about my plans at this point.  I hope ...   \n",
       "495   Oh, tighter financial conditions, sure.  Well, I think part of the reaction we’ve seen—and it comes from a number of sources—part of it comes from improved economic news and that’s part of the re...   \n",
       "497   Let me first restate the—I think the key point here, which is that the large majority of the participants of the FOMC, including voting and nonvoting members who are asked to describe their own a...   \n",
       "499   Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth.  There are a number of reasons for that.  One reason for it, though, is that it appears—and I talked about th...   \n",
       "501   So on the latter part, you know, of course, you’re seeing interest rate projections and inflation projections separately.  You’re not seeing them combined by individuals.  Each individual is maki...   \n",
       "503   Well, I don’t recall stating that we would do any particular thing in this meeting.  What we are going to do is the right thing for the economy.  And our assessment of the data since June is that...   \n",
       "505   Well, a factor that did concern us in our discussion was some upcoming fiscal policy decisions.  I would include both the possibility of a government shutdown, but also the debt limit issue.  The...   \n",
       "507   Well, on regrets, as Frank Sinatra says, I have many.  I think my—you know, reasonably, the biggest regret I have is that we didn’t forestall the crisis.  I think once the crisis got going, it wa...   \n",
       "509   Well, on the effectiveness of our asset purchases, it’s difficult to get a precise measure.  There’s a large academic literature on this subject, and they have a range of results, some suggesting...   \n",
       "511   Well, the two firms that have been designated, AIG and GE Capital, actually are—have been regulated by the Fed, because both of them are savings and loan, thrift holding companies.  So we have a ...   \n",
       "513   Well, it’s our intention to try to set policy as appropriate for the economy, as I said earlier.  We are somewhat concerned.  I won’t overstate it, but we do want to see the effects of higher int...   \n",
       "515   I think the Federal Reserve has strong institutional credibility.  And it is a strong institution, a highly competent institution, and it’s independent, it’s nonpartisan, and I’m not particularly...   \n",
       "517   Well, as I mentioned earlier, the Committee has regularly reviewed the forward guidance, and there are a number of ways in which the forward guidance could be strengthened.  For example, Mr. Ip m...   \n",
       "519   Sure.  So that’s certainly the case that there are too many people in poverty.  There are a lot of complex issues involved.  There are complex measurement issues, I would just have to mention tha...   \n",
       "521   Well, let me just talk about—I talked a little bit about the communication in June.  Let me talk just about the emerging markets, which I think is an important issue.  Let me just first say that ...   \n",
       "522   Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, the Committee decided, starting next month, to modest...   \n",
       "524   Well, as I said, the steps that we take will be data-dependent.  If we’re making progress in terms of inflation and continued job gains—and I imagine we’ll continue to do, probably at each meetin...   \n",
       "526   Sure.  On the first issue of $10 billion, again, we say we are going to take further modest steps subsequently, so that would be the general range.  But again, I want to emphasize that we are goi...   \n",
       "530   Well, again, these are individual estimates, there are big standard errors implicitly around them and so on.  We do think that inflation will gradually move back to 2 percent, and we allow for th...   \n",
       "532   Well, even under optimal control, it would take a while for inflation—inflation is quite—can be quite inertial.  It can take quite a time to move.  And the responsiveness of inflation to increasi...   \n",
       "534   Well, everything depends on what benchmark you compare it to, as you know.  I said last year that monetary policy was not a panacea.  It couldn’t solve all our problems.  And, in particular, it c...   \n",
       "536   Well, certainly, it’s a very—it was a very important was, did we feel comfortable that—to say that we had met, or were at least well on the way towards meeting, the criterion we set when we began...   \n",
       "542   If we could ask for it.  Well, we’re getting now to a fanciful discussion, I think.  I think our basic tools are asset purchases, and we are allowed only to buy Treasuries and agency securities. ...   \n",
       "546   The answer to the first question is “no.”  The answer to the second question is “I’ll be interested to see.”  I hope I live long enough to read the textbooks.  The—what we’ve showed—there’ve been...   \n",
       "548   Well, as I said before, asset purchases are a supplementary tool.  Our main tool is interest rate policy.  The reason that asset purchases are a supplementary tool is because it’s a much less fam...   \n",
       "550   Well, I think we want to make an assessment now.  I wouldn’t expect any changes in the very near term.  We want to see how much accommodation we have and whether it’s sufficient, whether the econ...   \n",
       "552   Well, again, we’re not doing less.  We’ll see how accommodation shapes up.  But while we are slowing asset purchases a bit, again, we expect the total balance sheet to be quite large and maintain...   \n",
       "554   So, we’ve been in a—it’s been about a little over four years now since the recovery began, four and a half years.  It’s been a slow recovery.  There are a number of reasons for that.  It’s—of cou...   \n",
       "556   Well, as always, of course, I don’t address specific fiscal actions.  I will say a couple of things about this deal.  One is that, relative to where we were in like it’s going to pass both houses...   \n",
       "558   Yes, the system is certainly safer, and one indication of that is the amount of capital that large banks hold.  So, for example, on the capital side, we have imposed Basel III requirements, much ...   \n",
       "560   Well, on the centennial review, let me just say, first, that one of the things that I’m proud of, and I’ve tried to accomplish over the past eight years, is to increase the transparency of the Fe...   \n",
       "564   Ah.  So, most of my family now is in North Carolina, and I’ve got a number of family members in Charlotte and also in Durham.  So my wife and I are going to spend the Christmas vacation in North ...   \n",
       "566   Okay, good.   But I think for the immediate future, my wife and I, I believe, will stay in Washington for a bit of time.   About investment, I think there are a lot of reasons why investment is w...   \n",
       "568   So I will answer your question, and I’ll try and help maybe do a better job on Binya’s question as well.  We do think, again, of the asset purchases as a secondary tool behind interest rate polic...   \n",
       "570   Well, it’s very hard to know—in terms of the study, it’s very hard to know.  It’s an imprecise science to try to measure these effects.  You have to obviously ask yourself, you know, what would h...   \n",
       "572   Yes.  Well, obviously it has a big economic effect on those directly affected, you know, who are receiving benefits, and we do have an unusually large number of long-term unemployed people in the...   \n",
       "574   Excellent question.  Well, I think the first thing to agree to is that Congress is our boss.  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency within the government.  It’s important that we maintain ...   \n",
       "576   I think a lot of the declines in the participation rate are, in fact, demographic or structural, reflecting sociological trends.  Many of the changes that we’re seeing now, we were also seeing to...   \n",

       "550  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think we want to make an assessment now.  I wouldn’t expect any changes in the very near term.  We want to see how much accommodation we have and whether it’s sufficien...   \n",
       "552  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, we’re not doing less.  We’ll see how accommodation shapes up.  But while we are slowing asset purchases a bit, again, we expect the total balance sheet to be quite...   \n",
       "554  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, we’ve been in a—it’s been about a little over four years now since the recovery began, four and a half years.  It’s been a slow recovery.  There are a number of reasons for...   \n",
       "556  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as always, of course, I don’t address specific fiscal actions.  I will say a couple of things about this deal.  One is that, relative to where we were in like it’s going ...   \n",
       "558  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, the system is certainly safer, and one indication of that is the amount of capital that large banks hold.  So, for example, on the capital side, we have imposed Basel III ...   \n",
       "560  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the centennial review, let me just say, first, that one of the things that I’m proud of, and I’ve tried to accomplish over the past eight years, is to increase the tra...   \n",
       "564  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Ah.  So, most of my family now is in North Carolina, and I’ve got a number of family members in Charlotte and also in Durham.  So my wife and I are going to spend the Christmas...   \n",
       "566  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay, good.   But I think for the immediate future, my wife and I, I believe, will stay in Washington for a bit of time.   About investment, I think there are a lot of reasons ...   \n",
       "568  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So I will answer your question, and I’ll try and help maybe do a better job on Binya’s question as well.  We do think, again, of the asset purchases as a secondary tool behind ...   \n",
       "570  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s very hard to know—in terms of the study, it’s very hard to know.  It’s an imprecise science to try to measure these effects.  You have to obviously ask yourself, you...   \n",
       "572  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  Well, obviously it has a big economic effect on those directly affected, you know, who are receiving benefits, and we do have an unusually large number of long-term unemp...   \n",
       "574  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Excellent question.  Well, I think the first thing to agree to is that Congress is our boss.  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency within the government.  It’s importan...   \n",

       "65   [ Well, you know, the reason we use terms like “extended period” is not to be intentionally opaque.  The reason is that we don’t know exactly how long.  I think the—I think the thrust of “extended...   \n",
       "67   [ Well, if the economy worsens and inflation remains relatively low, then we wouldn’t begin to exit, and, therefore, we wouldn’t change the language.  The expected length of keeping rates low woul...   \n",
       "71   [ Well, I don’t think it would be constructive for me to give you a tentative projection because, obviously, as I’ve indicated, there’s simply no alternative but to watch the incoming data and to ...   \n",

       "75   [ Well, we expect—as the projections show, we expect growth in the second half of this year and next year to be certainly faster than it’s been so far in 2011.  And as a result, we would expect to...   \n",
       "76   [ Well, there are a couple of considerations.  One, as I indicated before, is that the current outlook is significantly different than what we were facing in—in August of last year.  We no longer ...   \n",
       "78   [ Well, I’m a little bit more sympathetic to central bankers now than I was 10 years ago.  I think it’s very important to understand that in my comments—both in my comment in the published comment...   \n",
       "80   [ Well, it’s pretty impossible to create a statistical trigger because we have currently 17 independent members of the FOMC.  Each has his or her own view on the outlook, on the efficacy of moneta...   \n",
       "82   [ Well, the housing sector is very important to the overall recovery, and so we’ve paid a lot of attention to that.  We did—as you point out, we did succeed in significantly lowering the mortgage ...   \n",
       "83   [ Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open our policy strategy.  I will then be glad to take your questions.  ...   \n",
       "85   [ Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to stay nonpartisan and out of those debates.  I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promo...   \n",
       "87   [ Well, I’m not going to comment on that.  I—we listen to everybody’s input, and the most important thing is that we are free to make the decision based on the interest of the American people, wha...   \n",
       "89   [ So the Fed’s mandate is, of course, a dual mandate.  We have a mandate for both employment and for price stability, and we have a framework in place that allows us to communicate and to think ab...   \n",
       "91   [ Well, as I’ve said before, I certainly understand that many people are dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  I’m dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  Unemployment is far too high....   \n",
       "93   [ Well, the statement says “at least” mid-2013.  So, clearly, it could well be some point beyond that, and markets are currently anticipating a somewhat later liftoff.  One of the things we discus...   \n",
       "95   [ Yes, I’ll be glad to.  You were absolutely correct—first, that ultimately we would like to return our portfolio to Treasuries only.  That may be some time down the road at this point.  You’re al...   \n",
       "97   [ Well, most of the—a great deal of the investment in the U.S. takes the form of purchases of U.S. government debt in Treasury securities.  And that, in turn, reflects the desire for the liquidity...   \n",
       "99   [ Certainly.  The New York Federal Reserve Bank approved MF Global to be a primary dealer; I believe it was in February of this year.  At that time, the company met the criteria that had been set ...   \n",
       "103  [ The question is, Should the Fed be monitoring its primary dealers?  Only if the Fed is the supervisor.  In this case, the combination of a  broker–dealer and a futures commission merchant imply ...   \n",
       "105  [ Well, it’s a perfectly fair question.  And, you know, we spend a lot of time reviewing those errors.  The staff, in particular, presents us with information on forecast errors and on revisions, ...   \n",
       "107  [ No, it’s a fair question.  I would first say that monetary policy is having effects on the economy.  And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effe...   \n",
       "109  [ Well, I don’t think I can be as precise as you would like.  I—the MBS purchases and Treasury securities purchases are one set of tools that we have.  The other set of tools that we have are comm...   \n",
       "111  [ Again, I can’t speak for my colleagues on the Committee.  I will say that that forecast we have is satisfactory in one dimension, in the sense that inflation remains low and stable, but it is ve...   \n",
       "113  [ Well, we are committed to, and are in the process of, implementing Basel III, which has a basic requirement including a buffer of 7 percent, and then additional surcharges for the largest instit...   \n",
       "115  [ So, as you point out, our forecast is not a very satisfactory one in the sense that unemployment is very high and growth is very slow.  We have taken a lot of actions.  Let me be very clear that...   \n",
       "117  [ Well, I don’t want to make excuses.  Again, we did overestimate the pace of recovery for some fundamental reasons having to do with, as I mentioned, the time taken to achieve financial repair, t...   \n",
       "119  [ Well, again, as I noted in my opening remarks, no decisions have been made, so I want to be very clear that no final—you know, there is no final outcome here in this discussion.  But clearly, th...   \n",
       "121  [ Well, it is a bit frustrating.  Obviously, the key ultimately it’s their responsibility to find solutions to this very difficult problem.  Of course, I and the Treasury Secretary and other econo...   \n",
       "123  [ Sure.  It’s a little bit early to fully assess the effects of what we call the maturity extension program.  But it does seem to be having, at least in a preliminary sense—it does seem to be havi...   \n",
       "125  [ Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation.  We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—that ...   \n",
       "127  [ We did see some improvement in the third quarter, a modest improvement.  We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventories, therefo...   \n",
       "128  [ Good afternoon.  Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved new measures to support the recovery and employment growth.  I’ll get to the specifics of our actions in a few mo...   \n",
       "130  [ Yes.  We’ll be looking for signs that the economy is strong enough to promote improvement and sustained improvement in labor market conditions and 6 of 25 we’re all the way back to full employme...   \n",
       "132  [ Well, we’ve been talking about our communications at the FOMC and trying to think about how best to communicate to the public, you know, what our policy reaction function, so to speak, is.  And ...   \n",
       "134  [ Well, our policy approach doesn’t involve intentionally trying to raise inflation.  That’s not the objective.  The idea is to make sure we provide enough support so the economy will grow fast en...   \n",
       "136  [ Well, if inflation goes above the target level, as we talked about in our statement in January, we take a balanced approach.  We bring inflation back to the target over time, but we do it in a w...   \n",

       "140  [ Well, what happens is going to depend on where the economy goes—how much ultimate accommodation we give the economy.  The 0.4 percent you’re referring to is the change in the forecast between th...   \n",
       "142  [ Well, the ultimate effect is going to depend, of course, on how much we end up doing, and that, in turn, is going to depend on what the economy does.  9 of 25 This is a conditional program; we’r...   \n",
       "144  [ Well, there’s a variety of possibilities, and we continue to look at all different options.  But the two primary types of tools, as I’ve discussed, are balance sheet actions—and, of course, we c...   \n",
       "146  [ Well we are—this is a Main Street policy, because what we’re about here is trying to get jobs going.  We are trying to create more employment, we are trying to meet our maximum employment mandat...   \n",
       "148  [ Well, again, we’re looking for ongoing sustained improvement in the labor market.  There’s not a specific number we have in mind.  But what we’ve seen in the last six months isn’t it.  We’re loo...   \n",
       "150  [ Well, we—the problem is that, for this purpose, that what we’re looking for is a general improvement in labor market conditions.  We want to see the unemployment rate come down, but that’s not t...   \n",
       "152  [ Well, now you’re talking about congressional programs, and I don’t, you know, I don’t advocate specific programs.  It’s up to them to make those helping is a stronger housing market.  One reason...   \n",
       "154  [ On the latter, when Operation Twist ends, we will be looking at the whole set of asset purchases in order to make decisions.  We’ll be looking at the state of the economy, as we described in the...   \n",
       "156  [ Well, on the former, I’m—I have a lot to do.  I am very focused on my work, and I don’t have any decision or any information to give you on my personal plans.  On the politics, we have tried ver...   \n",
       "158  [ Certainly.  We are very interested in and very focused on community banks at the Fed.  We believe they play a very important role in our economy and in our communities.  We have a number of ways...   \n",
       "160  [ Well, as you know, we are living in a very complex time and dealing with a complex economic situation and a variety of novel and different issues, including new policies that haven’t been used i...   \n",
       "162  [ There’s going to be negative commentary whether it comes from Fed officials or not.  Again, because there’s a range of views—some people think it’s more effective than others.  I discussed some ...   \n",
       "164  [ Well there’s, again, a range of areas where actions could be taken, and I can’t really prescribe all those possible responses.  I would focus, I think, on the fiscal side.  We currently have the...   \n",
       "166  [ Well, the—on inflation, we do anticipate at some point what’s normal in a recovery, which is, given that the economy fell very quickly and there’s a lot of unused capacity, there’s a lot of slac...   \n",
       "168  [ Well, that’s an important question.  Michael Woodford— who, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well, and I know his works quite well—I think, actuall...   \n",

       "172  [ Well, I think there’ll be some, but you get more benefit when people buy homes.  And sales of homes are down still, but they have been rising steadily, and we’re trying to provide more support f...   \n",
       "174  [ Well I—you know, it’s pretty hard to give you a number, but I can certainly confirm that as the Reserve Bank presidents and Governors made their reports today and yesterday around the table, the...   \n",
       "176  [ Well, we take the economy as we find it.  There are a lot of headwinds right now that are affecting the economy.  There’s fiscal headwinds.  There’s international factors, including the situatio...   \n",
       "177  [ Well, you are absolutely right.  And as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation.  Some decline in participat...   \n",

       "182  [ Well, let me first observe that we have in fact, of course, been very accommodative in the last couple of years.  We’ve kept interest rates close to zero, we’ve done two rounds of asset purchase...   \n",
       "184  [ Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years.  Certainly, we are seeing a reversal, or at least a flattening out, of the commodit...   \n",
       "186  [ Well, your first question—our ability to forecast three and four years out is obviously very limited, there’s no question about that.  Nevertheless, we have to make a best guess, a provisional p...   \n",
       "188  [ Well, the period of time, yes, we treat them symmetrically.  We cannot control, of course, where inflation and unemployment are at each moment in time, and so there will be periods when, for rea...   \n",
       "190  [ So I’m not going to get involved in political rhetoric.  I’m just going to stay completely away from that.  I have a job to do, and as long as I’m here, I will do everything I can to help the Fe...   \n",
       "192  [ Well, you’re referring, I think, to the 165–166 rules, which will focus on the supervisory oversight of the largest banks.  It’s a very big and complicated rule, as everyone knows, and so our po...   \n",

       "546  [ The answer to the first question is “no.”  The answer to the second question is “I’ll be interested to see.”  I hope I live long enough to read the textbooks.  The—what we’ve showed—there’ve bee...   \n",

       "554  [ So, we’ve been in a—it’s been about a little over four years now since the recovery began, four and a half years.  It’s been a slow recovery.  There are a number of reasons for that.  It’s—of co...   \n",
